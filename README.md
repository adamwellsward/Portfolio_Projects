**Welcome!**

This repository contains both my personal coding projects and group projects with their associated papers. 
Each folder contains one of my most recent projects, as detailed below:

**AUTO-HARMONIZER:**

  The "melodyhub" dataset used in this project is located on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sander-wood/melodyhub), using the data labeled "harmonization" (see `abc_utils.py` for       useful scripts to seamlessly load and work with this data). Using a Hidden Markov Model, my group and I predicted the harmonizing chords of folk music using the melody notes as observed data with   moderate success! (see our paper for details, Mozart_or_Mess.pdf)

  Necessary packages:
  - [music21](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/)

**AVATAR:**

  An NLP approach to analyzing my favorite TV series of all time, Avatar: The Last Airbender. Sentiment analysis was performed using the Hugging Face 'transformers' 
  package to discover insights into different characters' dialogue patterns.

**CAR ACCIDENT SEVERITY:**

  Using a variety of ML techniques, my team and I leveraged a national data set with 7.7 million data points to predict car accident severity in the state of Utah. Includes a 5-page technical paper   documenting techniques and results (Ward_Accident_Severity_Writeup.pdf).

**MODELING RELATIONSHIP HAPPINESS:**

  Implementation of numerical methods to plot Ordinary Differential Equations modeling individual happiness in relationships. Includes a 10-page paper documenting techniques and results (Ward_Relationship_Modeling_Writeup.pdf).

**MOONLANDER OPTIMAL CONTROL:**

  Modeling the classic Atari game 'Lunar Lander' as a continuous optimal control problem and analyzing resulting trajectories, controls, and trade-offs (credit to @jpatrickb for the API and much of the documentation). Includes our 10-page paper documenting our methods and future research directions (Math_438_Project.pdf).
  
**PROJECT EULER:**

  Includes over 35 solutions (and counting!) to basic Project Euler coding problems. My side gig.
