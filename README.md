For ACME Volume 3 project.

The [melodyhub dataset we are using is located on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sander-wood/melodyhub). For now, we are using only the items labeled with task "harmonization". See `abc_utils.py` for useful scripts to seamlessly load and work with this data.

Necessary packages:
- [music21](https://www.music21.org/music21docs/)
