91,140,Aang,  see  now my tongue is stuck to my staff ,1,3
92,142,Iroh,  again ,1,1
93,144,Iroh,  no    power in firebending comes from the breath    not the muscles    the breath becomes energy in the body  the energy extends past your limbs and becomes  fire    get it right this time ,1,3
94,145,Zuko,  enough  ive been drilling this sequence all day  teach me the next set  im more than ready ,1,3
95,146,Iroh,no  you are impatient    you have yet to master your basics    drill it again ,1,3
96,148,Zuko,  the sages tell us that the avatar is the last airbender    he must be over a hundred years old by now  hes had a century to master the four elements  ill need more than basic firebending to defeat him    you will teach me the advanced set ,1,3
97,149,Iroh,  very well    but first  i must finish my roast duck   ,1,1
98,151,Sokka,  now men  its important that you show no fear when you face a firebender    in the water tribe  we fight to the last man standing  for without courage  how can we call ourselves men   ,1,3
99,154,Sokka,  listen  until your fathers return from the war  theyre counting on you to be the men of this tribe  and that means no potty breaks   ,1,3
100,156,Sokka,  okay  who else has to go ,1,3

113,180,Katara,  no  youre looking at the only waterbender in the whole south pole ,1,3
114,181,Aang,this isnt right  a waterbender needs to master water    what about the north pole  theres another water tribe up there  right  maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you ,1,2
115,182,Katara,maybe  but we havent had contact with our sister tribe in a long time  its not exactly  turn right at the second glacier   its on the other side of the world ,1,2
116,183,Aang,but you forget  i have a flying bison    appa and i can personally fly you to the north pole  katara  were going to find you a master ,1,3
117,184,Katara,  thats     i mean  i dont know  ive never left home before ,1,1

131,202,Aang,  what   thats impossible  do i look like a hundred twelve year old man to you ,1,1
132,203,Katara,think about it  the war is a century old  you dont know about it because  somehow  you were in there the whole time    its the only explanation ,1,3
133,205,Aang,a hundred years    i cant believe it ,1,1

267,420,Zuko,  dont mention his name on these docks    once word gets out that hes alive  every firebender will be out looking for him  and i dont want anyone getting in the way ,3,3
268,423,Zuko,  captain zhao ,3,3
269,425,Iroh,  retired general ,3,3
270,427,Iroh,our ship is being repaired ,3,3
271,430,Zuko,yes    you wouldnt believe what happened    uncle  tell commander zhao what happened ,3,3
272,431,Iroh,  yes  i will do that    it was incredible    what  did we crash or something ,3,0

282,446,Aang,  what about em ,3,1
283,447,Katara,  well  i just want you to be prepared for what you might see  the fire nation is ruthless    they killed my mother  and they could have done the same to your people ,3,2
284,448,Aang,  just because no one has seen an airbender  doesnt mean the fire nation killed them all  they probably escaped ,3,2
285,449,Katara,  i know its hard to accept ,3,1
286,450,Aang,  you dont understand  katara  the only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison  and i doubt the fire nation has any flying bison    right  appa ,3,3
287,452,Aang,yip yip ,3,1
288,454,Aang,  there it is  the southern air temple ,3,3

293,465,Zuko,  we havent found him yet ,3,3
294,467,Zuko,  no    nothing ,3,1

296,474,Sokka,so where do i get something to eat ,3,1
297,476,Katara,  youre lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple  and all you can think about is food ,3,3
298,478,Sokka,im just a simple guy  with simple needs ,3,1
299,480,Aang,  so thats where my friends and i would play airball    and over there   is where the bison would sleep  and      ,3,3
300,482,Katara,whats wrong ,3,1
301,483,Aang,  this place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison  now theres just a bunch of weeds    i cant believe how much things have changed ,3,1
302,485,Sokka,  so uh  this airball game  how do you play ,3,1
303,487,Aang,  aang  seven    sokka  zero ,3,3

312,499,Sokka,  you know  you cant protect him forever ,3,3
313,501,Sokka,  katara  firebenders were here  you cant pretend they werent ,3,1
314,503,Katara,i can for aangs sake  if he finds out that the fire nation invaded his home  hell be devastated ,3,3

330,536,Aang,  katara  whoevers in there might help figure out this avatar thing ,3,2
331,537,Sokka,  and whoevers in there might have   a medley of delicious   cured meats ,3,2
332,539,Sokka,i dont suppose you have a key ,3,3

744,1363,Katara,  well see about that ,6,1
745,1365,Katara,earthbenders  you dont know me  but i know of you  every child in my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave earth kingdom  and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders    some of you may think that the fire nation has made you powerless  yes  they have taken away your ability to bend  but they cant take away your courage  and it is your courage they should truly fear  because it runs deeper than any mine youve been forced to dig  any ocean that keeps you far from home  it is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are  hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away  the time to fight back is now  i can tell you the avatar has returned  so remember your courage earthbenders    let us fight for our freedom ,6,3

757,1379,Aang,  go hide ,6,1
758,1396,Sokka,we dont have much time  what are we gonna do ,6,1
759,1397,Aang,i wish i knew how to make a hurricane ,6,1
760,1399,Aang,the warden would run away and wed steal his keys ,6,3
761,1400,Sokka,wouldnt he just take his keys with him ,6,3
762,1401,Aang,im just tossing ideas around ,6,1
763,1402,Katara,i tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but  it didnt work  if there was just a way to help them help themselves ,6,1
764,1403,Sokka,for that theyd need some kind of earth  or some rock  something they can bend ,6,3
765,1404,Katara,  but this entire place is made of metal ,6,3
766,1405,Aang,no  its not    look at the smoke  i bet theyre burning coal  in other words  earth ,6,1
767,1407,Katara,its almost dawn  were running out of time  you sure this is gonna work ,6,2
768,1408,Sokka,it should  these vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village  were gonna do the same thing  but on a much bigger scale    theres a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo  and the whole system is ventilated  aang closed off all the vents except one  when he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go  right back here ,6,3
769,1411,Sokka,stay back  im warning you   ,6,1
770,1415,Katara,  heres your chance  earthbenders  take it  your fate is in your own hands ,6,3
771,1424,Aang,  guys  throw me some coal ,6,1
772,1430,Katara,  all it took was a little coal ,6,1

1017,1869,Iroh,actually  someone did  i assure you  it is a matter of utmost importance  prince zuko   ,9,3
1018,1870,Zuko,  is it something to do with the avatar ,9,3
1019,1871,Iroh,even more urgent  it seems  i     i have lost my lotus tile   ,9,1
1020,1872,Zuko,  lotus tile ,9,1
1021,1873,Iroh,for my pai sho game  most people think the lotus tile insignificant  but it is essential for the unusual strategy that i employ ,9,3
1022,1874,Zuko,  youve changed our course for a stupid lotus tile ,9,1
1023,1875,Iroh,see  you  like most people  underestimate its value  just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call    hopefully  they will have the lotus tile in stock and i can get on with my life    im lucky to have such an understanding nephew ,9,3
1024,1877,Sokka,yeah  dont get too happy  youve got to do me next   ,9,1
1025,1879,Katara,this is a pretty basic move  but it still took me months to perfect  so dont get frustrated if you dont get it right away    just push and pull the water like this  the key is getting the wrist movement right ,9,0
1026,1880,Aang,  like this   ,9,1
1027,1881,Katara,  thats almost right  if you keep practicing im sure eventually ,9,2
1028,1882,Aang,hey  im bending it already   ,9,1
1029,1883,Katara,  wow  i cant believe you got that so quickly  it took me two months to learn that move ,9,1
1030,1884,Aang,  well  you had to figure it all on your own  im lucky enough to have a great teacher ,9,1
1031,1885,Katara,  thanks ,9,0
1032,1886,Aang,so  whats next ,9,1
1033,1887,Katara,this is a more difficult move  i call it streaming the water    its harder than it looks  so dont be disappointed if    nice work    though the over the head flare was unnecessary ,9,3
1034,1888,Aang,sorry    well  dont stop now  keep em coming ,9,1
1035,1889,Katara,  well i kind of know this one other move  but its pretty hard  i havent even totally figured it out yet  the idea is to create a big  powerful wave   ,9,3
1036,1890,Aang,so  like this   ,9,1
1037,1891,Sokka,  aang    ,9,1

1040,1894,Sokka,  yeah  ill say    you just  practiced  our supplies down the river   ,9,3
1041,1895,Aang,  uh  sorry    im sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff ,9,2
1042,1896,Sokka,my life was hard enough when you were just an airbender   ,9,1

1045,1900,Sokka,  it doesnt even work    see  even momo thinks its a piece of junk ,9,1

1051,1913,Aang,  where did you get a waterbending scroll ,9,1
1052,1915,Sokka,  wait a minute     sea loving traders  with suspiciously acquired merchandise    and pet reptile birds    you guys are pirates ,9,3
1053,1918,Katara,so  how much for the  uh  traded scroll ,9,3
1054,1920,Aang,  i know how to deal with these guys  katara  pirates love to haggle    watch and learn    lets say to the price of  one copper piece   ,9,3
1055,1922,Aang,  okay  two copper pieces ,9,3
1056,1924,Katara,  aang  can we get out of here  i feel like were getting weird looks ,9,1

1060,1929,Katara,  ill just feel a lot better once we get away from here ,9,1
1061,1932,Aang,  well  well  look whos come to their senses  told you the haggling would pay off ,9,3
1062,1934,Katara,  i dont think these pirates are here to trade with us   ,9,3
1063,1936,Sokka,  whoa   ,9,1
1064,1942,Aang,no thanks    grab on tight ,9,1
1065,1943,Katara,aang  i thought we were running away from the pirates   ,9,3
1066,1944,Aang,just hang on   ,9,1
1067,1946,Aang,  i used to kind of look up to pirates  but those guys are terrible ,9,1

1069,1948,Aang,  no way ,9,1
1070,1949,Katara,  isnt it great ,9,0
1071,1950,Sokka,no wonder they were trying to hack us up  you stole their waterbending scroll ,9,1
1072,1951,Katara,  i prefer to think of it as high risk trading ,9,2
1073,1952,Aang,  good one  katara ,9,0
1074,1953,Katara,sokka  where do you think they got it  they stole it from a waterbender ,9,3
1075,1954,Sokka,it doesnt matter  you put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid  fancy splashes ,9,1
1076,1955,Katara,these are real waterbending forms  you know how crucial it is for aang to learn waterbending ,9,0
1077,1956,Sokka,  whatever ,9,1
1078,1957,Aang,well  whats done is done  we have it  we might as well learn from it ,9,2
1079,1959,Iroh,ive checked all the shops on this pier  not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace ,9,3
1080,1960,Zuko,its good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone ,9,0
1081,1961,Iroh,quite the contrary  i always say  the only thing better than finding something you are looking for   is finding something you werent looking for at a great bargain   ,9,3
1082,1962,Zuko,you bought a tsungi horn ,9,3
1083,1963,Iroh,for music night on the ship  now  if we only had some woodwinds    oh  this place looks promising    oh  that is handsome  wouldnt it look magnificent in the galley ,9,3
1084,1965,Zuko,  this monk  did he have an arrow on his head   ,9,1
1085,1967,Katara,i just want to try this one move first and then its all yours    here  hold it open for me  the single water whip  looks doable    ow ,9,3
1086,1968,Sokka,ha  ha  ha ,9,1

1090,1972,Aang,youll get it    you just gotta shift your weight through the stances    there  see  the key to bending is ,9,3
1091,1973,Katara,  will you please shut your air hole  believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes  why dont we just throw the scroll away since youre so naturally gifted    what    oh my gosh  aang  i am so sorry  i dont know what came over me  but you know what  it wont happen again    here  this is yours  i dont want to have anything to do with it anymore ,9,1

1356,2446,Aang,look  sticking together is the only way to ,11,0
1357,2449,Aang,  any ideas ,11,3
1358,2454,Aang,  enough  i thought i could help you guys get along  but i guess thats not gonna happen    we should split up  gan jins on this side and zhangs on that side  well travel in two separate lines    sokka  you go with the zhangs and katara  you go with the gan jins  see if you can find out why they hate each other so much ,11,1

1370,2482,Aang,i wish i could help these people get along  but it just seems impossible  anyhow  i guess our biggest problem is getting out of here ,11,1
1371,2486,Aang,  katara  sokka  will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon ,11,3
1372,2487,Katara,i dont think so  aang  the zhangs really wronged the gan jins  they ambushed jin wei and stole the sacred orb ,11,3
1373,2488,Aang,what are you talking about ,11,1
1374,2489,Sokka,yeah katara  what are you talking about  wei jin didnt steal the orb  he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the gan jin ,11,3
1375,2490,Katara,not punished enough if you ask me ,11,3
1376,2491,Aang,  okay  okay i get it  now i need your help  i need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall    please everyone  as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways  but i need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff ,11,1
1377,2497,Aang,  guys  focus  how many times do i have to say it  harsh words wont solve problems  action will ,11,1
1378,2504,Aang,you know  i take it back  harsh words arent so bad ,11,1
1379,2506,Aang,  is that     food  everyone smuggled food down here  unbelievable  you guys put our lives in danger because you couldnt go without a snack for a day  youre all awful    so hungry  is that an egg custard in that tart   ,11,1
1380,2507,Katara,oh no  thats a lot of canyon crawlers ,11,1
1381,2508,Sokka,  we barely survived one ,11,1
1382,2510,Katara,sokka  wait    i dont care about this stupid feud  i just want us to get out of here alive ,11,1
1383,2511,Sokka,me too  i only took their side cause they fed me ,11,3

1385,2521,Aang,  wait a second     jin wei  wei jin  i know those guys ,11,1
1386,2523,Aang,no  i mean i really knew them  i might not look it  but im a hundred and twelve years old  i was there one hundred years ago on the day youre talking about    there seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened  first of all  jin wei and wei jin werent enemies  they were brothers  twins in fact  and they were eight  and most importantly  they were just playing a game  the sacred orb from the legend  that was the ball  and the eastern and western gates were the goal posts  jin wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it  wei jin didnt steal the ball  he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal  but he stepped out of bounds  so the official put him in the penalty box  not for twenty long years but for two short minutes    there was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison  it was just a game ,11,2
1387,2525,Aang,nope  just a regular ball ,11,3
1388,2527,Aang,thats what the game was called  redemption  as soon as you got the ball from one end to the other  everyone would yell  redemption     dont get me wrong  wei jin was kind of a slob and jin wei was a little stuffy  that much is true  but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field ,11,1
1389,2531,Aang,good to see you  boy  did you miss me   ,11,0
1390,2533,Aang,  well  you know i try ,11,1
1391,2538,Sokka,thats some luck you knew jin wei and wei jin ,11,0
1392,2539,Aang,you could call it luck  or you could call it lying ,11,3
1393,2540,Sokka,  what ,11,1
1394,2541,Aang,i made the whole thing up ,11,1
1395,2542,Katara,  you did not    that is so wrong ,11,1

1415,2573,Sokka,  food eats people    also  momo could talk    you said some very unkind things ,12,1

1418,2578,Iroh,a storm is approaching from the north    i suggest we alter our course and head southwest ,12,3
1419,2579,Zuko,  we know the avatar is traveling northward  so we will do the same ,12,3
1420,2580,Iroh,  prince zuko  consider the safety of the crew ,12,3
1421,2581,Zuko,  the safety of the crew doesnt matter ,12,3
1422,2583,Zuko,finding the avatar is far more important than any individuals safety ,12,3
1423,2585,Iroh,  he doesnt mean that  hes just all worked up ,12,3
1424,2588,Katara,  i dont know if i like the sound of that swishing ,12,1
1425,2590,Aang,  i think its true  katara  swishing means its ripe ,12,3
1426,2591,Katara,  i just realized were out of money anyway ,12,1
1427,2594,Sokka,out of food and out of money  now what are we supposed to do ,12,3
1428,2595,Katara,you could get a job  smart guy ,12,1
1429,2599,Aang,  maybe we should find some shelter ,12,2
1430,2600,Sokka,  are you kidding  shelter from what ,12,1

1432,2607,Sokka,  what  you said get a job     and hes paying double ,12,3
1433,2611,Iroh,  lucky guess ,12,1
1434,2612,Zuko,  lieutenant  youd better learn some respect     or i will teach it to you   ,12,3
1435,2615,Iroh,easy now    enough  were all a bit tired from being at sea so long  im sure after a bowl of noodles  everyone will feel much better ,12,1
1436,2617,Zuko,i dont need your help keeping order on my ship ,12,3

1439,2623,Katara,thats right   ,12,3
1440,2625,Katara,dont yell at him  aang would never turn his back on anyone ,12,3

1446,2638,Katara,its okay  that fisherman was way out of line ,12,1
1447,2639,Aang,actually  he wasnt ,12,3
1448,2640,Katara,  what do you mean ,12,1
1449,2641,Aang,  i dont want to talk about it ,12,1
1450,2642,Katara,it has to do with your dream  doesnt it    talk to me ,12,0
1451,2643,Aang,well  its kind of a long story ,12,1
1452,2645,Katara,im going to try to get a little fire going ,12,1
1453,2647,Aang,ill never forget the day the monks told me i was the avatar  i was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall  i was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter ,12,1
1454,2649,Aang,first you got to form the ball  then you got to get on quick ,12,3
1455,2653,Aang,you kind of have to balance on it like its a top ,12,1
1456,2656,Aang,i made it up ,12,1
1457,2661,Aang,how do you know its me ,12,1
1458,2664,Aang,those were some of my favorite toys when i was little   ,12,1
1459,2666,Aang,i just chose them because they seemed fun ,12,1
1460,2674,Iroh,do you really want to know ,12,1
1461,2677,Iroh,its okay  may i join you ,12,3
1462,2680,Iroh,  try to understand  my nephew is a complicated young man  he has been through much ,12,3
1463,2682,Young Zuko,let me in ,12,1
1464,2683,Iroh,  prince zuko  whats wrong ,12,1
1465,2684,Young Zuko,i want to go into the war chamber   but the guard wont let me pass ,12,3
1466,2685,Iroh,  youre not missing anything  trust me  these meetings are dreadfully boring ,12,1
1467,2686,Young Zuko,if im going to rule this nation one day  dont you think i need to start learning as much as i can ,12,1
1468,2687,Iroh,very well  but you must promise not to speak    these old folks are a bit sensitive  you know ,12,1
1469,2688,Young Zuko,  thank you  uncle ,12,1
1470,2693,Young Zuko,  you cant sacrifice an entire division like that  those soldiers love and defend our nation  how can you betray them ,12,3
1471,2695,Iroh,zuko was right  you see    but it was not his place to speak out  and there were dire consequences   ,12,3
1472,2697,Katara,so you were upset that you were the avatar  why wouldnt you be excited about it ,12,0
1473,2698,Aang,well  i didnt know how to feel about it  all i knew was that after i found out  everything began changing ,12,1
1474,2700,Aang,hey  not bad  you guys have been practicing ,12,1
1475,2702,Aang,great    whats going on ,12,1
1476,2704,Aang,but im still the same  nothings changed  so  what  i cant play ,12,1
1477,2706,Aang,oh  okay ,12,1
1478,2712,Aang,what do you mean ,12,1
1479,2714,Aang,hey ,12,1
1480,2722,Iroh,after zukos outburst in the meeting  the fire lord became very angry with him    he said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect  and there was only one way to resolve this ,12,3
1481,2724,Iroh,thats right  zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid  but zuko misunderstood    when he turned to face his opponent  he was surprised to see it was not the general    zuko had spoken out against the generals plan  but by doing so in the fire lords war room  it was the fire lord whom he had disrespected    zuko would have to duel his own father ,12,3
1482,2726,Aang,then  just when i was feeling better  something worse happened ,12,1
1483,2734,Katara,thats awful  aang  i dont know what to say ,12,1
1484,2735,Aang,  how could they do that to me  they wanted to take away everything i knew and everyone i loved   ,12,1
1485,2736,Katara,whoa  hot cinders ,12,1
1486,2738,Aang,im sorry i got so mad ,12,1
1487,2739,Katara,you have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that ,12,3
1488,2740,Aang,well  thats not exactly what happened    i was afraid and confused  i didnt know what to do ,12,1
1489,2743,Aang,  i never saw gyatso again    next thing i knew  i was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg ,12,1
1490,2745,Katara,you ran away ,12,1
1491,2746,Aang,and then the fire nation attacked our temple  my people needed me and i wasnt there to help ,12,3
1492,2747,Katara,you dont know what would have  ,12,3
1493,2748,Aang,the world needed me and i wasnt there to help ,12,1
1494,2749,Katara,aang    ,12,1

1685,3158,Sokka,of course i am  and to tell you the truth  ive been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you  too ,14,1
1686,3159,Aang,  she does ,14,1
1687,3160,Sokka,oh yeah  shes crazy about you  all you have to do now is not mess it up ,14,3
1688,3161,Aang,well  how do i do that ,14,1

1690,3163,Aang,you can be too nice ,14,1
1691,3164,Sokka,yep  if you want to keep her interested  you have to act aloof  like you dont really care one way or the other ,14,3
1692,3165,Aang,well  okay    ,14,1
1693,3168,Aang,see you later      ,14,1

1705,3188,Katara,  okay then  see you later ,14,3
1706,3190,Aang,  maybe aloof isnt my style ,14,2
1707,3194,Aang,  did you see that ,14,1
1708,3196,Aang,excuse me    where can a guy find one of those things ,14,3
1709,3198,Sokka,  i cant believe youre dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower ,14,1
1710,3199,Aang,not just any flower  a panda lily  ive seen it in action and boy  does it work ,14,3
1711,3201,Sokka,flowers are fine once youre married  but at this early stage  its critical that you maintain maximum aloofness ,14,1
1712,3202,Aang,but my heart is telling me to get this flower    and aunt wu said if i trusted in my heart  i will be with the one i love ,14,1
1713,3203,Sokka,  what  dont tell me you believe in that stuff  too ,14,1
1714,3204,Aang,  well  aunt wu hasnt been wrong yet  why should she be wrong about love    there  on the rim ,14,1
1715,3206,Aang,  oh no    aunt wu was wrong ,14,1
1716,3208,Sokka,those people all think theyre safe  weve got to warn them ,14,3
1717,3209,Aang,theres no time to walk    grab on   ,14,1
1718,3211,Aang,  hi  katara ,14,1
1719,3212,Katara,  can you believe she wont let me in  and after all the business ive given her ,14,3
1720,3213,Aang,but she doesnt even charge ,14,3
1721,3214,Katara,i know  but still    ,14,1
1722,3215,Sokka,well  we have other things to worry about  aunt wu was wrong about the volcano ,14,1
1723,3216,Katara,  sokka  you tried to convince me she was wrong before  its going to take an awful lot to change my mind  ,14,1
1724,3218,Katara,  oh no ,14,1
1725,3220,Sokka,  everyone  that volcano is gonna blow any second  aunt wu was wrong ,14,1
1726,3222,Katara,  if you wont listen to him  maybe youll listen to me  i want to believe aunt wu and her predictions as much as you do  but my brother and aang saw the lava with their own eyes ,14,2
1727,3224,Aang,  please listen to us  you are all in danger  and we have to get out of here  you cant rely on aunt wus prediction    you have to take fate into your own hands ,14,1
1728,3226,Sokka,look    can your fortune telling explain that ,14,1
1729,3229,Sokka,  yes  yes  it can ,14,1
1730,3231,Katara,  they just wont listen to reason   ,14,1
1731,3232,Aang,  but they will listen to aunt wu ,14,1
1732,3233,Sokka,i know thats the problem ,14,1
1733,3234,Aang,well  its about to become the solution  were taking fate in our own hands  first  i need to borrow aunt wus cloud reading book ,14,3
1734,3236,Aang,  shhh  we dont want anyone to hear us ,14,1

2042,3853,Aang,ugh ,17,1

2059,3893,Aang,thanks   ,17,0
2060,3895,Sokka,these lanterns are terrible  i cant see    why would you want to use fireflies for light   ,17,1
2061,3899,Sokka,  okay     so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room ,17,1
2062,3901,Sokka,so  this place is an explosion waiting to happen ,17,1
2063,3905,Katara,  ive changed my mind  i think i was born without that something ,17,1
2064,3907,Aang,spirit ,17,1
2065,3909,Aang,spirit  thats the something youre talking about ,17,1
2066,3913,Katara,no    aaaaah    i cant believe im flying ,17,1
2067,3915,Aang,just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you dont swallow a bug   ,17,1
2068,3916,Katara,teo was right about the air  all i had to do was trust it  let it carry me ,17,3
2069,3917,Aang,even though teos not an airbender  he really does have the spirit of one    ive been thinking  if you want to see whats in that room  id be happy to open the door for you ,17,3
2070,3919,Katara,wait    how do i land this thing  what if i land over   a ack ack bleck  bug  bug  ack  that was a bug ,17,1
2071,3922,Sokka,  ugh  week old egg smell ,17,1
2072,3927,Sokka,how can something so small that you cant even see it make such a big stink  ,17,1
2073,3930,Sokka,yeah       if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up    ,17,1
2074,3932,Sokka,then  if theres a leak    ,17,3
2075,3934,Sokka,and plug up the hole where the gas is escaping ,17,3
2076,3939,Aang,this is a nightmare ,17,0
2077,3941,Aang,  youre making weapons for the fire nation ,17,3
2078,3942,Sokka,  you make weapons for the fire nation  ,17,3
2079,3946,Aang,when are they coming ,17,1

2085,3967,Aang,ill tell you how  we have something they dont    air power  we control the sky  thats something the fire nation cant do  we can win ,17,3
2086,3969,Aang,good  well need it ,17,0
2087,3972,Sokka,thank you  youre a genius ,17,0
2088,3974,Sokka,see  the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air borne    but once it did  it just kept going    you could put a hole in the top  but then all the hot air would escape  so the question became  how do you keep a lid on hot air ,17,1
2089,3975,Katara,ugh  if only we knew   ,17,1
2090,3976,Sokka,a lid is actually the answer  if you control the hot air  you control the war balloon ,17,3
2091,3977,Katara,huh  thats actually pretty smart ,17,1
2092,3978,Sokka,okay  weve got four kinds of bombs    smoke  slime  fire  and    ,17,3
2093,3983,Katara,  yes  but wheres sokka with the war balloon ,17,3
2094,3984,Aang,  well have to start without it ,17,1
2095,3988,Aang,weve got them on the run  we need more slime ,17,1

2377,4618,Katara,  say hi to gran gran for me ,21,1
2378,4620,Iroh,this is what ive been missing  who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water  and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense    i see  its the anniversary  isnt it ,21,1
2379,4621,Zuko,  three years ago today  i was banished  i lost it all    i want it back  i want the avatar  i want my honor  my throne  i want my father not to think im worthless   ,21,1
2380,4622,Iroh,im sure he doesnt  why would he banish you if he didnt care    uh  that came out wrong  didnt it   ,21,1
2381,4624,Azula,  my brother and my uncle have disgraced the fire lord  and have brought shame on all of us  you might have mixed feelings about attacking members of the royal family  i understand  but i assure you  if you hesitate  i will not hesitate to bring you down  dismissed ,21,2
2382,4627,Azula,im sorry  captain  but i do not know much about the tides  could you explain something to me ,21,1
2383,4629,Azula,do the tides command this ship ,21,3
2384,4631,Azula,you said the tides would not allow us to bring the ship in    do the tides command this ship ,21,3
2385,4633,Azula,and if i were to have you thrown overboard  would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore ,21,3
2386,4635,Azula,  well then  maybe you should worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you  and worry more about me  whos still mulling it over   ,21,2
2387,4638,Sokka,  there it is ,21,1
2388,4641,Katara,  mighty katara  i like that ,21,1
2389,4643,Sokka,  not bad  not bad ,21,1
2390,4646,Aang,  i try not to think about it too much ,21,1
2391,4648,Aang,  what  no im not ,21,1
2392,4649,Katara,  aang still needs to master all four elements ,21,3
2393,4651,Sokka,but sir  the thing is  aang can only do those things when hes in the avatar state ,21,3
2394,4652,Aang,see  its this special state where ,21,3
2395,4654,Aang,  right  but  i dont know how to get in or out of the avatar state  much less what to do once im there ,21,1
2396,4656,Katara,  no  nothings decided  we already have a plan  aangs pursuing his destiny his way ,21,3
2397,4661,Azula,  almost isnt good enough ,21,2

2400,4667,Aang,  i told the general id help him  by going into the avatar state ,21,3
2401,4668,Katara,  aang  no  this is not the right way ,21,3
2402,4669,Sokka,  why not  remember when he took out the fire navy    he was incredible ,21,0
2403,4670,Katara,theres a right way to do this  practice  study  and discipline ,21,3
2404,4671,Sokka,  or just glow it up and stop that fire lord ,21,3
2405,4672,Katara,  if you two meat heads want to throw away everything weve worked for  fine  go ahead and glow it up   ,21,3
2406,4673,Aang,katara  im just being realistic  i dont have time to do this the right way ,21,0
2407,4676,Aang,ten fold energy  huh ,21,1
2408,4678,Aang,  is it working  is it working  i cant tell  somebody tell me if im in the avatar state cause i dont have a good view of myself  am i talking too loud ,21,0
2409,4679,Sokka,  i guess he could talk the fire lord to death ,21,3
2410,4681,Sokka,maybe i can shock you into the avatar state ,21,2
2411,4682,Aang,i love surprises ,21,0
2412,4684,Aang,  still not glowing ,21,3
2413,4688,Aang,  this is just mud ,21,1
2414,4693,Iroh,  look at these magnificent shells    ill enjoy these keepsakes for years to come ,21,0
2415,4694,Zuko,we dont need any more useless things  you forget  we have to carry everything ourselves now ,21,1

2420,4699,Iroh,  to what do we owe this honor ,21,3
2421,4700,Azula,hmmm     must be a family trait  both of you so quick to get to the point    ive come with a message from home  fathers changed his mind  family is suddenly very important to him  hes heard rumors of plans to overthrow him  treacherous plots  family are the only ones you can really trust    father regrets your banishment  he wants you home    did you hear me  you should be happy  excited  grateful  i just gave you great news ,21,0

2429,4709,Aang,im really glad you told me that  but i still need to do this ,21,1
2430,4710,Katara,  i dont understand ,21,1
2431,4711,Aang,  no  you dont  every day  more and more people die  im already one hundred years late  defeating the fire lord is the only way to stop this war  i have to try it ,21,3

2437,4718,Iroh,  i care about you  and if ozai wants you back  well  i think it may not be for the reasons you imagine ,21,3
2438,4719,Zuko,  you dont know how my father feels about me  you dont know anything ,21,3
2439,4720,Iroh,zuko  i only meant that in our family  things are not always what they seem ,21,1
2440,4721,Zuko,  i think you are exactly what you seem  a lazy  mistrustful  shallow old man whos always been jealous of his brother ,21,1
2441,4723,Aang,  sokka  sokka  wake up ,21,1
2442,4724,Sokka,huh ,21,1

2555,4970,Aang,  no  its a tomb ,22,1
2556,4972,Aang,it must be the two lovers from the legend  thats whos buried here ,22,3
2557,4973,Katara,these pictures tell their story ,22,1
2558,4975,Katara,  they met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages    ,22,3
2559,4977,Katara,  the villages were enemies  so they could not be together       but their love was strong and they found a way ,22,3
2560,4979,Katara,  the two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles  they became the first earthbenders ,22,3
2561,4981,Katara,  they built elaborate tunnels  so they could meet secretly    anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth    but  one day  the man didnt come     hed died in the war between the two villages    devastated  the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power   she could have destroyed them all       but  instead  she declared the war over    both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace    the womans name was oma and the mans name was shu    the great city was named omashu as a monument to their love ,22,0
2562,4983,Katara,  love is brightest   in the dark ,22,0
2563,4987,Sokka,  at least im thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here  moku ,22,1

2569,4996,Aang,katara  what is it ,22,1

2571,4998,Aang,right    ,22,1
2572,4999,Katara,  and here  it says   love is brightest in the dark   and has a picture of them kissing ,22,3

2779,5484,Aang,  i get how the tree is one big thing  but the whole world ,24,1
2780,5486,Katara,  but what did our visions mean ,24,3

2794,5520,Sokka,i told you  we were hungry  im eating a giant bug ,24,1

2797,5525,Sokka,well  no accounting for weather  still  theres absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp ,24,3
2798,5531,Sokka,  what are you doing in my mouth    momo  you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries ,25,3

2829,5596,Aang,  you think that i     murdered someone ,25,1
2830,5599,Aang,  huh ,25,1
2831,5600,Katara,  aang would never do something like that  no avatar would    and its not fair for you all to question his honor ,25,1
2832,5603,Aang,give me a chance to clear my name ,25,3
2833,5605,Aang,  ill gladly stand trial ,25,3
2834,5607,Aang,no problem ,25,1
2835,5609,Aang,  how was i supposed to know they wouldnt take water tribe money ,25,3
2836,5611,Sokka,so some people dont like you  big deal  theres a whole nation of firebenders who hate you  now lets bust you out of here ,25,1
2837,5612,Aang,i cant ,25,1
2838,5613,Sokka,  sure you can  a little   swish swish swish    airbending slice    and were on our way ,25,3
2839,5615,Katara,  i think what  master swish  is trying to say   is that youre supposed to be out saving the world  you cant do that locked up in here ,25,3
2840,5616,Aang,  i cant do that with people thinking im a murderer either  i need you guys to help prove my innocence ,25,1
2841,5617,Sokka,howre we gonna to do that  the crime happened over three hundred years ago ,25,3
2842,5618,Aang,  thats okay  sokka  for some reason  i thought you were an expert detective ,25,1
2843,5619,Sokka,  well  i guess i could be classified as such ,25,3
2844,5620,Katara,  yeah  back home  he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky ,25,1
2845,5621,Sokka,  everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard  but i figured out it was old man jarko wearing polar leopard boots    see  a real eight hundred pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks    okay  i guess i am pretty good ,25,0
2846,5622,Aang,so  youll help me with my case ,25,3
2847,5623,Sokka,  fine  but im going to need some new props    im ready    what ,25,1
2848,5627,Sokka,this temple and this statue were cut from the same stone    and we know that the statue was built after chin died ,25,3
2849,5628,Katara,  so if they were built at the same time  that means ,25,3
2850,5630,Sokka,  shhh  i wanna solve it    that means kyoshi never set foot in this temple ,25,3
2851,5631,Katara,thats a big hole in the mayors story    but its not enough to prove aangs innocence ,25,3
2852,5632,Sokka,youre right    we need to go to kyoshi island ,25,3
2853,5634,Katara,  where did you get that ,25,1
2854,5639,Katara,  he couldnt be here  koko ,25,3
2855,5643,Katara,oyaji  aang is in jail  the town of chin says he murdered their leader in a past life ,25,3
2856,5644,Sokka,they say it was kyoshi ,25,1
2857,5647,Sokka,  so  uh     whats suki up to  is she around ,25,3
2858,5650,Sokka,  oh  well     thats great ,25,1
2859,5653,Katara,  she had exquisite taste ,25,1
2860,5656,Sokka,these fans       they were her weapons  no ,25,3
2861,5658,Katara,  these were her boots  her feet must have been enormous ,25,3
2862,5661,Katara,  wait a minute     big feet    little footprint    theres no way ,25,1
2863,5663,Sokka,  special outfit  hat and pipe  these things mean anything to you ,25,1
2864,5664,Katara,  youre right  im sorry    please ,25,1
2865,5665,Sokka,  aha    theres no way kyoshi could have made that footprint    and therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene ,25,3
2866,5666,Katara,  brilliant  sokka   ,25,1
2867,5670,Aang,  you think so ,25,1
2868,5674,Aang,  i dont know    ,25,1
2869,5677,Aang,  you guys are great ,25,0
2870,5681,Sokka,  three hundred and seventy years  wait    are you sure it was today ,25,3
2871,5683,Sokka,  this ceremony didnt take place at sunrise  it took place at sunset    look at the shadows ,25,3
2872,5684,Katara,they point east  so the sun must have been in the west ,25,3
2873,5686,Sokka,  if kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset  she couldnt have been in chin committing the crime  she has an alibi   ,25,3
2874,5688,Katara,honorable mayor  weve prepared a solid defense for the avatar  we did an investigation and found some very strong evidence ,25,3
2875,5691,Aang,then how can i prove my innocence ,25,3
2876,5697,Sokka,  you can do it  aang  just remember the evidence ,25,3
2877,5698,Aang,  right     evidence    ladies and gentlemen     im about to tell you what really happened  and i will prove it with facts  fact number one    uhhh    ,25,1
2878,5699,Sokka,  the footprint ,25,3
2879,5700,Aang,oh  yeah  you see     i have very large feet    furthermore     your temple matches your statue    but     i was in a painting at sunset    so  there you have it  im not guilty ,25,3
2880,5702,Sokka,  hes dead ,25,1
2881,5704,Iroh,looks like you did some serious shopping    but where did you get the money ,25,1
2882,5705,Zuko,  do you like your new teapot ,25,1
2883,5706,Iroh,to be honest with you    the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup    i know weve had some difficult times lately  weve had to struggle just to get by    but its nothing to be ashamed of  there is a simple honor in poverty ,25,0
2884,5707,Zuko,theres no honor for me without the avatar ,25,3
2885,5708,Iroh,zuko       even if you did capture the avatar  im not so sure it would solve our problems  not now ,25,1
2886,5709,Zuko,  then there is no hope at all ,25,1
2887,5711,Iroh,no  zuko  you must never give in to despair  allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts    in the darkest times  hope is something you give yourself  that is the meaning of inner strength ,25,3
2888,5713,Katara,mayor tong  id like for the court to hear one last testimony ,25,3
2889,5715,Katara,this isnt just any witness  im going to call       avatar kyoshi herself ,25,3
2890,5717,Sokka,  what are you doing ,25,1
2891,5718,Katara,  well  she is aangs past life  maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something ,25,2
2892,5719,Sokka,  i do believe in the power of stuff ,25,1
2893,5721,Katara,  please  if you could just wait one more second  im sure kyoshi will be here ,25,3

3061,6155,Young Zuko,  great grandfather won     because    ,27,1
3062,6156,Young Azula,because even though his army was outnumbered  he cleverly calculated his advantages  the enemy was downwind and there was a drought  their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes ,27,3

3207,6393,Katara,are you sure hes okay to fly ,28,3
3208,6394,Aang,hell be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here    im going to use appas fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off course ,28,3
3209,6396,Iroh,ow     that really hurt my tailbone ,28,1
3210,6405,Azula,the avatars trying to give us the slip    you two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison    ill follow this trail ,28,3
3211,6407,Sokka,  toph couldnt have made it too far    what is it  momo  ooooh  no  katara ,28,1
3212,6409,Katara,  how did they find us ,28,1

3216,6414,Katara,  come on appa  just a little further    ,28,3
3217,6416,Sokka,  we made it  were safe ,28,3

3224,6430,Azula,  you mean you havent guessed  you dont see the family resemblance  heres a hint    i must find the avatar to restore my honor    its okay  you can laugh  its funny ,28,3
3225,6431,Aang,so what now ,28,1
3226,6432,Azula,  now  now  its over  youre tired and you have no place to go    you can run  but ill catch you ,28,1
3227,6433,Aang,  im not running ,28,1
3228,6435,Iroh,  here is your tea    you seem a little too young to be traveling alone ,28,1
3229,6436,Toph,  you seem a little too old ,28,1
3230,6437,Iroh,  perhaps i am ,28,3
3231,6438,Toph,  i know what youre thinking     i look like i cant handle being by myself ,28,1
3232,6439,Iroh,i wasnt thinking that ,28,1
3233,6440,Toph,you wouldnt even let me pour my own cup of tea ,28,3
3234,6441,Iroh,i poured your tea because i wanted to and for no other reason ,28,1
3235,6442,Toph,people see me and think im weak  they want to take care of me  but i can take care of myself  by myself ,28,1
3236,6443,Iroh,you sound like my nephew  always thinking you need to do things on your own  without anyones support  there is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you  not that i love you  i just met you ,28,1
3237,6444,Toph,  so where is your nephew ,28,1
3238,6445,Iroh,ive been tracking him actually ,28,3
3239,6446,Toph,is he lost ,28,1
3240,6447,Iroh,  yes  a little bit    his life has recently changed and hes going through very difficult times  hes trying to figure out who he is and he went away ,28,1
3241,6448,Toph,so now youre following him ,28,3
3242,6449,Iroh,i know he doesnt want me around him right now  but if he needs me  ill be there ,28,1
3243,6450,Toph,your nephew is very lucky  even if he doesnt know it    thank you ,28,0
3244,6451,Iroh,my pleasure  sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of lifes true delights ,28,0
3245,6452,Toph,  no  thank you for what you said  it helped me ,28,3
3246,6453,Iroh,im glad ,28,1
3247,6454,Toph,  oh  and about your nephew  maybe you should tell him that you need him  too ,28,2
3248,6456,Azula,do you really want to fight me ,28,1
3249,6458,Zuko,yes  i really do ,28,1
3250,6459,Aang,  zuko ,28,1
3251,6460,Azula,  i was wondering when youd show up  zuzu ,28,1
3252,6461,Aang,   zuzu  ,28,1

3260,6473,Azula,  well  look at this  enemies and traitors  all working together  im done    i know when im beaten  you got me  a princess surrenders with honor ,28,3

3262,6477,Zuko,  ugggh    get away from us ,28,1
3263,6479,Katara,zuko  i can help ,28,1
3264,6480,Zuko,  leave ,28,1
3265,6484,Aang,todays the day    can you believe it  after all that time searching for a teacher  im finally starting earthbending    and this place    its perfect  dont you think  sokka    oh  youre still sleeping  huh    sorry ,29,0
3266,6486,Toph,goooood morning    earthbending student ,29,1
3267,6488,Aang,good morning  sifu toph ,29,0
3268,6489,Katara,  hey  you never called me sifu katara ,29,1
3269,6490,Aang,  well  if you think i should    ,29,1
3270,6492,Toph,sorry  snoozles  well do our earthbending as   quietly as we can ,29,3
3271,6494,Aang,  so what move are you going to teach me first    rock a lanche    the trembler  oh  maybe i could learn to make a   whirlpool out of land ,29,2
3272,6495,Toph,  lets start with       move a rock ,29,1
3273,6496,Aang,  sounds good  sounds good ,29,0
3274,6498,Toph,the key to earthbending is your stance  youve got to be steady and strong  rock is a stubborn element  if youre going to move it  youve got to be like a rock yourself ,29,3
3275,6499,Aang,like a rock  got it ,29,1
3276,6500,Toph,good  now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple    okay  you ready to give it a try ,29,0
3277,6501,Aang,im ready   ,29,3
3278,6502,Sokka,  rock beats airbender ,29,1
3279,6506,Iroh,my beloved lu ten  i will see you again ,29,1
3280,6508,Zuko,uncle     you were unconscious  azula did this to you  it was a surprise attack ,29,3
3281,6509,Iroh,somehow  thats not so surprising   ,29,3
3282,6510,Zuko,  i hope i made it the way you like it   ,29,1
3283,6511,Iroh,  good  that was very     uhhh     bracing   ,29,0
3284,6512,Zuko,so uncle  ive been thinking  its only a matter of time before i run into azula again  im going to need to know more advanced firebending if i want to stand a chance against her  i know what youre going to say  shes my sister and i should be trying to get along with her ,29,3
3285,6513,Iroh,  no  shes crazy  and she needs to go down    its time to resume your training ,29,1
3286,6515,Katara,i dont understand what went wrong  he did it exactly the way you did ,29,1
3287,6516,Aang,maybe theres another way     what if i came at the boulder from another angle ,29,2
3288,6517,Toph,no  thats the problem  youve got to stop thinking like an airbender  theres no different angle  no clever solution  no trickety trick thats going to move that rock  youve got to face it head on  and when i say head on  i mean like this      ,29,1
3289,6518,Aang,whoa ,29,1
3290,6520,Katara,  ive been training aang for a while now  he really responds well to a positive teaching experience  lots of encouragement and praise  kind words  if hes doing something wrong  maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction ,29,2
3291,6521,Toph,thanks  katara  a gentle nudge  ill try that    keep your knees high  twinkle toes ,29,1
3292,6523,Toph,rock like ,29,0
3293,6525,Toph,rock like ,29,0
3294,6527,Sokka,youre awfully cute  but unfortunately youre made of meat  just a bit closer       gotcha    you are one lucky little meat creature ,29,1
3295,6529,Iroh,lightning is a pure form of firebending  without aggression  it is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is  some call lightning the cold blooded fire  it is precise and deadly  like azula  to perform the technique requires peace of mind ,29,3
3296,6530,Zuko,i see  thats why were drinking tea  to calm the mind ,29,1
3297,6531,Iroh,oh yeah  good point  i mean  yes    there is energy all around us  the energy is both yin and yang  positive energy and negative energy  only a select few firebenders can separate these energies  this creates an imbalance  the energy wants to restore balance  and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together  you provide release and guidance  creating lightning   ,29,0
3298,6532,Zuko,im ready to try it ,29,1
3299,6533,Iroh,remember  once you separate the energy  you do not command it  you are simply its humble guide  breathe first ,29,3
3300,6535,Toph,this time were going to try something a little different  instead of moving a rock  youre going to stop a rock  get in your horse stance  im going to roll that boulder down at you  if you have the attitude of an earthbender  youll stay in your stance and stop the rock  like this   ,29,1
3301,6536,Katara,sorry toph  but are you really sure this is the way to teach aang earthbending ,29,1
3302,6537,Toph,im glad you said something  actually there is a better way    this way  youll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it  thank you  katara ,29,0
3303,6538,Aang,  yeah  thanks  katara ,29,1
3304,6539,Katara,  heh ,29,1
3305,6541,Aang,i guess i just panicked  i dont know what to say ,29,1
3306,6542,Toph,theres nothing to say  you blew it  you had a perfect stance  and a perfect form  but when it came right down to it  you didnt have the guts ,29,0
3307,6543,Aang,  i know  im sorry ,29,1
3308,6544,Toph,yeah  you are sorry  if youre not tough enough to stop the rock  then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly boned wimp  now  do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender ,29,1
3309,6545,Aang,no  i dont think i do ,29,1
3310,6546,Katara,aang  its no big deal  youll take a break and try earthbending again when youre ready  besides  you still have a lot of waterbending to work on  okay ,29,1
3311,6547,Aang,yeah  that sounds good ,29,0
3312,6548,Toph,yeah  whatever  go splash around until you feel better ,29,1
3313,6551,Zuko,why cant i do it  instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face     like everything always does ,29,1
3314,6552,Iroh,i was afraid this might happen  you will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you ,29,2
3315,6553,Zuko,what turmoil ,29,1
3316,6554,Iroh,zuko  you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away ,29,1
3317,6555,Zuko,but i dont feel any shame at all  im as proud as ever ,29,1
3318,6556,Iroh,prince zuko  pride is not the opposite of shame  but its source  true humility is the only antidote to shame ,29,3
3319,6557,Zuko,well  my life has been nothing but humbling lately ,29,1
3320,6558,Iroh,i have another idea  i will teach you a firebending move that even azula doesnt know  because i made it up myself   ,29,3
3321,6560,Sokka,you probably think i deserve this  dont you  look  im sorry i hunted you  but thats just the natural order of things  big things eat smaller things  nothing personal  but this time it didnt work out that way  i admit it     youre cute  okay  you convinced me  if i get out of this alive  its a karmically correct  vegetarian existence for me  no meat  even though meat is so tasty    hey  looks like my karma is already paying off  thats okay  i got it    now  come back boomerang ,29,2
3322,6562,Katara,you know this block youre having is only temporary  right ,29,3
3323,6563,Aang,i dont want to talk about it ,29,1
3324,6564,Katara,you do realize thats the problem  dont you  if you face this issue instead of avoiding it ,29,1
3325,6565,Aang,  i know  i know  i know  i know  i get it  all right  i need to face it head on like a rock  but i just cant do it  i dont know why i cant  but i cant ,29,1
3326,6566,Katara,aang  if fire and water are opposites  then whats the opposite of air ,29,3
3327,6567,Aang,i guess its earth ,29,1
3328,6568,Katara,thats why its so difficult for you to get this  youre working with your natural opposite  but youll figure it out  i know you will  think fast    excellent  you have the reflexes of a waterbending master ,29,0
3329,6569,Aang,thanks  katara  sifu katara   ,29,1
3330,6571,Iroh,fire is the element of power    the people of the fire nation have desire and will  and the energy to drive and achieve what they want  earth is the element of substance    the people of the earth kingdom are diverse and strong  they are persistent and enduring  air is the element of freedom    the air nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom  also  they apparently had pretty good senses of humor    water is the element of change    the people of the water tribe are capable of adapting to many things  they have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything ,29,0
3331,6572,Zuko,why are you telling me these things ,29,1
3332,6573,Iroh,it is important to draw wisdom from many different places  if you take it from only one place  it becomes rigid and stale    understanding others  the other elements  and the other nations will help you become whole   ,29,3
3333,6574,Zuko,all this four elements talk is sounding like avatar stuff ,29,1
3334,6575,Iroh,it is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the avatar so powerful  but it can make you more powerful  too  you see the technique im about to teach you is one i learned by studying the waterbenders ,29,3
3335,6577,Toph,aang  i found these nuts in your bag  i figured you wouldnt mind  and besides  even if you did  youre too much of a pushover to do anything about it ,29,1
3336,6578,Aang,as a matter of fact  i dont mind  im happy to share anything i have ,29,1
3337,6579,Toph,you know  im really glad you feel that way  because i also have this great new nutcracker ,29,1
3338,6581,Aang,actually  i prefer if you didnt       thats an antique  handcrafted by the monks       its a delicate instrument ,29,3
3339,6582,Toph,its not the only delicate instrument around here   ,29,3
3340,6583,Aang,  ohm ,29,1
3341,6584,Katara,hey aang  have you seen ,29,1
3342,6585,Aang,  meditating here ,29,1
3343,6586,Katara,its important  its almost sundown and sokka isnt back yet  i think we should search for him ,29,2
3344,6587,Aang,well find him faster if we split up   ,29,3
3345,6589,Sokka,okay  karma person or thing  whoevers in charge of this stuff  if i can just get out of this situation alive  i will give up meat and sarcasm  okay    ow  thats all i got  its pretty much my whole identity  sokka  the meat and sarcasm guy  but im willing to be sokka  the veggies and straight talk fellow  deal    aang  thank goodness  have you got any meat ,29,3
3346,6590,Aang,sokka  are you okay   ,29,1
3347,6591,Sokka,aggh  stop  stop  youre going to pull my fingers off and i dont think the rest of me is coming ,29,1
3348,6592,Aang,hmmm     i bet i can airbend you out of here   ,29,1
3349,6593,Sokka,seriously aang  i know youre new at it  but i could use a little earthbending here  how about it ,29,1
3350,6594,Aang,i cant     i cant do it ,29,1
3351,6595,Sokka,well  if you cant earthbend me out of here  go get toph ,29,1
3352,6596,Aang,i cant do that either ,29,1
3353,6597,Sokka,you cant  why not ,29,1
3354,6598,Aang,it would just be really     uncomfortable ,29,1
3355,6599,Sokka,uncomfortable    well  i wouldnt want you to feel uncomfortable    ,29,1
3356,6600,Aang,thanks  sokka  this whole earthbending thing really has me confused  theres so much pressure  everyone expects me to get it right away  it puts me in a really awkward position ,29,1
3357,6601,Sokka,awkward position  i think i know the feeling ,29,1
3358,6602,Aang,if i try  i fail  if i dont try  im never going to get it  i feel like im caught between a rock and a hard place ,29,1
3359,6603,Sokka,hmmm     how about that  aang  this is my friend  foo foo cuddlypoops  foo foo cuddlypoops  aang ,29,1
3360,6604,Aang,awww  what a cute name for a baby saber tooth moose lion cub ,29,1
3361,6605,Sokka,really  he looks nothing like a saber tooth moose lion ,29,1
3362,6606,Aang,its hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in  what are you doing out here little guy  did you lose your mama ,29,1
3363,6609,Iroh,waterbenders deal with the flow of energy  a waterbender lets their defense become their offense  turning their opponents energy against them  i learned a way to do this with lightning ,29,3
3364,6610,Zuko,you can teach me to redirect lightning ,29,3
3365,6611,Iroh,if you let the energy in your own body flow  the lightning will follow it  you must create a pathway from your fingertips  up your arm to your shoulder  then down into your stomach  the stomach is the source of energy in your body  it is called the sea of chi  only in my case it is more like a vast ocean    from the stomach  you direct it up again  and out the other arm  the stomach detour is critical  you must not let the lightning pass through your heart  or the damage could be deadly  you may wish to try a physical motion  to get a feel for the pathways flow  like this    now  are you focusing your energy  can you feel your own chi flowing in  down  up  and out ,29,3
3366,6612,Zuko,i think so ,29,1
3367,6613,Iroh,come on  youve got to feel the flow    excellent  youve got it ,29,0
3368,6614,Zuko,great  im ready to try it with real lightning ,29,0
3369,6615,Iroh,what  are you crazy  lightning is very dangerous ,29,1
3370,6616,Zuko,i thought that was the point  you teaching me to protect myself from it ,29,3
3371,6617,Iroh,yeah  but im not going to shoot lightning at you  if youre lucky  you will never have to use this technique at all ,29,3
3372,6618,Zuko,well  if you wont help me  ill find my own lightning   ,29,3
3373,6620,Aang,hey there  we found your cub  see  we have no problem with you  were friendly ,29,1
3374,6621,Sokka,aang  this is bad  youve got to get me out of here ,29,1
3375,6623,Sokka,this is really bad  please aang  you have to earthbend me out  theres no other way ,29,1
3376,6625,Aang,oh no    woo hoo  look at me ,29,1
3377,6627,Sokka,please  dont leave me again ,29,1
3378,6628,Aang,i wont ,29,1
3379,6630,Sokka,what are you doing here ,29,1

3465,6782,Sokka,  bright enough to fool you ,30,1
3466,6784,Toph,  so     you like     flying    of course  im more comfortable on the ground where i can see  well  i dont see the way you do  i feel the vibrations in the ground with my feet    but this sand is so loose and shifty  it makes everything look fuzzy    not that theres anything wrong with fuzzy   ,30,1
3467,6786,Aang,  hey  look at these weird lion turtle things ,30,1
3468,6787,Sokka,  eh  ive seen weirder ,30,1
3469,6788,Katara,  aang  did you know in a past life  you were left handed ,30,1
3470,6789,Aang,i always knew i was special ,30,1
3471,6791,Sokka,   the darkest day in fire nation history   its got a date at the top  but it doesnt say anything else   ,30,3
3472,6792,Aang,  sokka  where are you going ,30,1
3473,6793,Sokka,  i want to know what happened to the fire nation on their darkest day  this could be promising    the information on the fire nation should be right up here ,30,3
3474,6794,Aang,  firebenders ,30,3
3475,6795,Katara,they destroyed everything having to do with the fire nation ,30,3
3476,6796,Sokka,thats so unfair  just when i think im one step ahead of the fire nation  it turns out they beat us here a long time ago    i need to know what happened on the darkest day    hello  little weird fox guy ,30,1
3477,6799,Sokka,um  sure  i guess ill follow you ,30,1
3478,6803,Sokka,uh  this is beautiful  but how is it helpful ,30,1
3479,6804,Katara,maybe these dials represent dates and times  sokka  try entering that date from that parchment you took ,30,2
3480,6805,Sokka,  shh  katara  not in front of the fox  hes with the owl ,30,3

3482,6809,Katara,hey  wait  what happened to the sun ,30,1
3483,6810,Aang,  great  you must have broken it ,30,1
3484,6811,Sokka,  its not broken    the sun is behind the moon  its a solar eclipse  its literally the darkest day in fire nation history  now i get it    something awful happened on that day  i dont know what  but i do know why  firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse    sorry ,30,1
3485,6812,Katara,that makes sense  i mean  think what the lunar eclipse at the north pole did to the waterbenders  this is huge ,30,3
3486,6814,Sokka,  fine  you earned it    weve gotta get this information to the earth king at ba sing se  well wait for the next eclipse  then well invade the fire nation when theyre totally helpless  the fire lord is going down ,30,3
3487,6816,Sokka,you dont understand  if anyones evil  its the fire nation  you saw what they did to your library  theyre destructive and dangerous  we need this information ,30,3
3488,6818,Aang,we had no choice  please  were just desperate to protect the people we love ,30,3
3489,6820,Aang,what are you doing ,30,1
3490,6822,Katara,  hes sinking the building  weve gotta get out of here ,30,3

3502,6843,Aang,why are we doing this ,30,1
3503,6844,Sokka,because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past  then maybe it can project when the next one will be ,30,2
3504,6845,Aang,you cant possibly check every single date ,30,3
3505,6846,Sokka,  i dont have to  we just need to check every date before sozins comet arrives  because after that  well  try not to think about that ,30,1

3609,7054,Zuko,  now that you played pai sho  are you going to do some flower arranging  or is someone in this club going to offer some real help  ,31,3
3610,7055,Iroh,you must forgive my nephew  he is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts ,31,3
3611,7058,Iroh,one who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries ,31,3
3612,7060,Iroh,im afraid its members only  wait out here ,31,1
3613,7062,Katara,the needle on this compass doesnt seem to be pointing north according to my charts ,31,3
3614,7064,Sokka,  take it easy little lady  im sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here ,31,0
3615,7066,Katara,thats what the compass is pointing to  that giant rock  it must be the magnetic center of the desert ,31,3
3616,7067,Toph,  a rock    yes  lets go ,31,3
3617,7068,Katara,  maybe we can find some water there ,31,2
3618,7069,Aang,  maybe we can find some sandbenders ,31,2
3619,7071,Toph,ahhh     finally  solid ground ,31,3
3620,7073,Sokka,  i think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice  and look ,31,3
3621,7075,Sokka,tastes like rotten penguin meat  awww  i feel woozy ,31,1
3622,7076,Katara,  youve been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave   ,31,1
3623,7077,Sokka,i have a natural curiosity ,31,1
3624,7078,Toph,i dont think this is a normal cave  this was carved by something ,31,1

3642,7109,Iroh,we can hide in plain sight there  and its the safest place in the world from the fire nation  even i couldnt break through to the city   ,31,3
3643,7116,Katara,we found the sailer abandoned in the desert  were traveling with the avatar    our bison was stolen and we have to get to ba sing se ,31,1

3658,7161,Sokka,okay  we just got out of the desert  so we must be around here  and we need to go to ba sing se  which is here  it looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the serpents pass ,32,3
3659,7162,Toph,you sure thats the best way to go ,32,0
3660,7163,Sokka,its the only way  i mean  its not like we have appa to fly us there ,32,1

3705,7255,Katara,it says   abandon hope  ,32,3
3706,7257,Aang,i dont know  the monks used to say that hope was just a distraction  so maybe we do need to abandon it ,32,2
3707,7258,Katara,what are you talking about ,32,1
3708,7259,Aang,hope is not going to get us into ba sing se and its not going to help find appa  we need to focus on what were doing right now and thats getting across this path ,32,1

3779,7398,Aang,im the avatar  take me to whoever is in charge ,33,3
3780,7401,Aang,not needed ,33,3

3782,7405,Toph,yeah  thanks for the tour  but we still got the drill problem ,33,1

3785,7414,Toph,maybe youd like the avatars help now ,33,2
3786,7417,Aang,the question is  how are we going to stop that thing   ,33,1
3787,7418,Sokka,why are you all looking at me ,33,1
3788,7419,Aang,youre the idea guy ,33,1
3789,7420,Sokka,  so im the only one who can ever come up with a plan  thats a lot of pressure ,33,3
3790,7421,Katara,and also the complaining guy ,33,1
3791,7422,Sokka,that part i dont mind ,33,1
3792,7425,Iroh,its pronounced mushi ,33,3
3793,7427,Iroh,  uh  no  no  but may i just say youre like a flower in bloom  your beauty is intoxicating ,33,1
3794,7429,Zuko,  im going to forget i saw that   ,33,1
3795,7440,Katara,his chi is blocked    who did this to you ,33,3
3796,7442,Katara,  ty lee  she doesnt look dangerous  but she knows the human body and its weak points  its like she takes you down from the inside ,33,3
3797,7443,Sokka,  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh ,33,1
3798,7444,Katara,yes ,33,1
3799,7445,Sokka,what you just said  thats how were going to take down the drill  the same way ty lee took down all those big earthbenders ,33,1
3800,7446,Toph,by hitting its pressure points ,33,3
3801,7447,Aang,  well take it down from the inside ,33,3
3802,7449,Toph,  once i whip up some cover  youre not going to be able to see  so  stay close to me ,33,1
3803,7451,Toph,run ,33,1
3804,7456,Toph,everyone into the hole ,33,1
3805,7458,Sokka,its so dark down here  i cant see a thing ,33,1
3806,7459,Toph,  oh no  what a nightmare ,33,1
3807,7460,Sokka,  sorry ,33,1
3808,7462,Sokka,there ,33,1
3809,7464,Sokka,toph  come on ,33,1
3810,7465,Toph,no way am i going in that metal monster  i cant bend in there  ill try to slow it down out here ,33,1
3811,7466,Sokka,okay  good luck   ,33,0
3812,7468,Sokka,i need a plan of this machine  some schematics that show what the inside looks like  then we can find its weak points ,33,3
3813,7469,Aang,where are we going to get something like that    what are you doing  someones going to hear us ,33,1
3814,7470,Sokka,thats the point  i figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it  and when something breaks    ,33,1
3815,7471,Katara,they come to fix it ,33,1
3816,7473,Katara,  hi ,33,1
3817,7475,Sokka,thisll work  thanks ,33,0
3818,7477,Sokka,it looks like the drill is made up of two main structures  theres the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell  the inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces  if we cut through them  the entire thing will collapse ,33,3
3819,7481,Iroh,  ooh  jasmine please ,33,1
3820,7483,Iroh,blaugh  ugh  coldest tea in ba sing se is more like it  what a disgrace ,33,3
3821,7487,Zuko,thanks  but i dont think you want me in your gang ,33,1
3822,7489,Zuko,  i said no ,33,1
3823,7492,Iroh,hey ,33,1
3824,7493,Zuko,  what are you doing firebending your tea  for a wise  old man  that was a pretty stupid move ,33,1
3825,7494,Iroh,  i know youre not supposed to cry over spilled tea  but       its just so sad ,33,1
3826,7496,Sokka,wow  it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans  were going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that ,33,3
3827,7497,Katara,  whats this  we  stuff  aang and i are going to have to do all the work ,33,3
3828,7498,Sokka,  look  im the plan guy  you two   are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys    together  were team avatar ,33,3
3829,7500,Sokka,  cmon team  dont quit now    were    ,33,3
3830,7501,Katara,  grrr ,33,1
3831,7503,Sokka,i mean    youre almost there ,33,2
3832,7505,Katara,  at this rate  we wont do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall ,33,3
3833,7506,Aang,i dont know how many more of those i have in me ,33,1
3834,7508,Sokka,do you hear that  we took it down  we better get out of here fast ,33,1
3835,7512,Sokka,  cmon brace     budge   ,33,3
3836,7513,Katara,this is bad  really bad ,33,1
3837,7514,Sokka,were putting everything weve got into busting these braces  but its taking too long ,33,1
3838,7515,Aang,  maybe we dont need to cut all the way through  toph has been teaching me that you shouldnt give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike    sokka  take a fighting stance  youve got to be quick and accurate  hit a series of points and break your opponents stance    and when hes reeling back  you deliver the final blow    his own weight becomes his downfall  literally ,33,2
3839,7517,Katara,so we just need to weaken the braces  instead of cutting all the way through ,33,3
3840,7518,Aang,then ill go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow ,33,3
3841,7519,Sokka,  and boom  it all comes crashing down ,33,3

4154,8306,Zuko,if you dont want to end up like him  youll do what i say ,37,1
4155,8308,Katara,the dai li must have sent jet to mislead us  and that janitor was part of their plot  too ,37,3
4156,8309,Aang,i bet they have appa here in the city  maybe hes in the same place they took jet  where did they take you ,37,2
4157,8311,Aang,we need to find a way to jog his real memories ,37,3
4158,8312,Sokka,  maybe katara should kiss him  that should bring something back ,37,2

4179,8364,Zuko,first i have to get it out of here ,37,1
4180,8365,Iroh,  and then what   you never think these things through    this is exactly what happened when you captured the avatar at the north pole  you had him  and then you had nowhere to go ,37,3
4181,8366,Zuko,i would have figured something out ,37,1
4182,8367,Iroh,no  if his friends hadnt found you  you would have frozen to death ,37,1
4183,8368,Zuko,i know my own destiny  uncle ,37,1
4184,8369,Iroh,is it your own destiny  or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you ,37,3
4185,8370,Zuko,stop it  uncle  i have to do this ,37,1
4186,8371,Iroh,im begging you  prince zuko  its time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions  who are you  and what do you want ,37,1
4187,8373,Aang,jet  its me  aang    you dont have to do this ,37,1
4188,8376,Aang,jet  im your friend  look inside your heart ,37,1

4194,8395,Aang,appas gone  long feng beat us here ,37,1
4195,8396,Sokka,if we keep moving  maybe we can catch up with them ,37,2
4196,8398,Sokka,you think we can outrun them ,37,3
4197,8399,Aang,i dont think its gonna matter ,37,1
4198,8401,Aang,what is it  momo ,37,1
4199,8403,Aang,appa ,37,1

4204,8415,Sokka,look  we escaped from the dai li  we got appa back  im telling you  we should go to the earth king now and tell him our plan  were on a roll ,38,3
4205,8416,Katara,one good hour after weeks of trouble isnt much of a roll ,38,0
4206,8417,Sokka,we can build on it  if we want to invade the fire nation when the eclipse happens  well need the earth kings support ,38,3
4207,8418,Toph,what makes you think well get it  i dont know if youve noticed  but things dont usually go that smoothly for our little gang ,38,1
4208,8419,Sokka,i know  but ive got a good feeling about this  this time will be different ,38,0
4209,8420,Katara,sokka  long feng is in control of the city  his conspiracy with the dai li is too powerful  i think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us ,38,3
4210,8421,Toph,im with sweetness  ive seen enough of ba sing se    and i cant even see ,38,1
4211,8423,Aang,but now that we have appa back  theres nothing stopping us from telling the earth king the truth  about the conspiracy and the war ,38,3
4212,8424,Sokka,see  aangs with me    its the whole reason we came here in the first place  we have to try ,38,3
4213,8425,Katara,  well  i guess if the earth king knew the truth  things could change   ,38,3
4214,8426,Toph,  i dont trust the new positive sokka    long feng brainwashed you  didnt he  ,38,3
4215,8428,Sokka,thats probably the dai li searching for us    so ,38,2

4217,8432,Toph,can we please buy a new saddle  riding bareback is terrifying   ,38,3
4218,8434,Sokka,there it is  that whole thing is the palace  the earth kings chamber should be in the center ,38,3
4219,8435,Katara,we have to be careful  long fengs probably warned the king that were coming ,38,2
4220,8436,Sokka,why would you assume that  if you ask me  i think were just gonna sail right in and    aahh ,38,1

4243,8482,Aang,long feng didnt want us to tell you  so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us  and blackmail is the least of his crimes  he brainwashed our friend ,38,3
4244,8488,Sokka,wait    i can prove hes lying  long feng said hes never seen a sky bison  ask him to lift his robe ,38,3
4245,8491,Aang,right there  appa bit him ,38,1
4246,8492,Sokka,never met a sky bison  huh ,38,3

4253,8508,Toph,its gone ,38,1
4254,8509,Sokka,oh dont tell me      thats okay  still got my positive attitude ,38,1
4255,8510,Katara,the dai li mustve known we were coming and destroyed the evidence ,38,3
4256,8512,Sokka,hey  if anything  this proves the conspiracy exists even more   ,38,3
4257,8514,Katara,  the wall  theyll never be able to cover that up in time ,38,3
4258,8515,Aang,oh  yeah    if you come with us to the outer wall  we can prove to you that the secret war is real ,38,3
4259,8517,Sokka,  if you come with us  this time you can ride on appa   ,38,1

4265,8538,Sokka,its a drill  a giant drill   made by the fire nation to break through your walls   ,38,3
4266,8542,Katara,  really  then perhaps you could explain why theres a   fire nation insignia on your  construction project  ,38,3
4267,8547,Sokka,  looks like long feng is long gone  ha  ah  yeah  ive been waiting to use that one   ,38,1
4268,8550,Sokka,thats why we came to ba sing se  your highness  because we think you can help us end the war ,38,3
4269,8551,Aang,  we dont have much time  theres a comet coming this summer  its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength  theyll be unstoppable ,38,3
4270,8552,Sokka,but there is hope  before the comet comes  we have a window of opportunity  a solar eclipse is coming  the sun will be completely blocked out by the moon  and the firebenders will be helpless ,38,3
4271,8554,Sokka,thats the day we need to invade the fire nation    the day of black sun ,38,3
4272,8556,Sokka,youre already vulnerable  the fire nation wont stop until ba sing se falls  you can either sit back and wait for that to happen  or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance ,38,3
4273,8564,Aang,secret files ,38,3

4339,8684,Azula,from the inside  were in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the earth king  the key is the dai li  whoever controls the dai li   controls ba sing se ,39,0

4370,8770,Aang,this is the last chakra  isnt it ,39,3
4371,8772,Aang,  lets do this ,39,3
4372,8774,Aang,  what  why would i let go of katara  i     i love her ,39,1
4373,8776,Aang,why would i choose cosmic energy over katara    how could it be a bad thing that i feel an attachment to her  three chakras ago that was a good thing ,39,1
4374,8779,Katara,thank goodness youre here  suki  something terrible is going on  the fire nation has infiltrated the city  i just saw prince zuko and his uncle    we have to tell the earth king right away ,39,1
4375,8780,Azula,oh  dont worry  ill be sure to let him know ,39,1
4376,8782,Azula,  so  zuzus in the city  too  i think its time for a family reunion   ,39,1
4377,8784,Aang,im sorry  but i cant let go of katara ,39,1
4378,8786,Aang,okay  ill try ,39,1
4379,8789,Aang,kataras in danger  i have to go   ,39,1
4380,8794,Toph,  its not  its the real deal ,39,3
4381,8796,Toph,  i am the greatest earthbender in the world  dont you two dunderheads ever forget it   ,39,0
4382,8801,Sokka,you dont know how much this means to me  dad  ill make you proud and ill finally prove to you what a great warrior i am ,39,3
4383,8803,Sokka,really ,39,1
4384,8806,Sokka,this cant be good news ,39,0
4385,8808,Azula,what is this about  your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here  you will not treat a kyoshi warrior this way ,39,3
4386,8810,Azula,what do you want ,39,1
4387,8812,Azula,oh ,39,1
4388,8814,Azula,why should i help you ,39,1
4389,8816,Azula,  im listening    ,39,1
4390,8819,Iroh,  i     i cant believe it ,39,1
4391,8820,Zuko,what is it  uncle ,39,1
4392,8821,Iroh,  great news  weve been invited to serve tea to the earth king   ,39,3
4393,8824,Sokka,so  what kind of trouble is katara in ,40,1
4394,8825,Aang,i dont know  in my vision  i just knew she needed help ,40,1
4395,8826,Sokka,it would be nice if your avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time    what is that ,40,3
4396,8828,Sokka,need a ride ,40,1
4397,8830,Azula,  the earth king and the council of five do not trust the dai li  they imprisoned your leader  long feng  soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you  seizing power today is a matter of life and death    this coup must be swift and decisive  the earth king and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously  long feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government    if i sense any disloyalty  any hesitation  any weakness at all    i will snuff it out    that is all ,40,3
4398,8834,Azula,there are still a few loose ends  the avatar  and my brother and uncle ,40,3
4399,8836,Iroh,many times i imagined myself here  at the threshold of the palace    but i always thought i would be here as a conqueror  instead  we are the earth kings personal guests  here to serve him tea  destiny is a funny thing ,40,3
4400,8837,Zuko,it sure is  uncle ,40,3
4401,8839,Toph,so how did it go with the guru  did you master the avatar state ,40,3
4402,8840,Aang,uh    ,40,1
4403,8844,Sokka,aang  are you okay ,40,1
4404,8845,Aang,im great  it went great with the guru  i completely mastered the avatar state    yeah ,40,3
4405,8847,Zuko,whats taking so long ,40,1
4406,8848,Iroh,maybe the earth king overslept ,40,2
4407,8850,Zuko,somethings not right ,40,3
4408,8852,Azula,its tea time ,40,1
4409,8853,Zuko,  azula ,40,1
4410,8854,Azula,have you met the dai li  theyre earthbenders  but they have a killer instinct thats so firebender  i just love it ,40,1
4411,8856,Iroh,did i ever tell you how i got the nickname  the dragon of the west  ,40,1
4412,8857,Azula,im not interested in a lengthy anecdote  uncle   ,40,3
4413,8858,Iroh,its more of a demonstration  really ,40,3
4414,8860,Iroh,come on  youll be fine ,40,1
4415,8861,Zuko,no  im tired of running  its time i faced azula ,40,1
4416,8863,Azula,youre so dramatic  what  are you going to challenge me to an agni kai ,40,1
4417,8864,Zuko,yes  i challenge you ,40,1
4418,8865,Azula,no thanks ,40,1
4419,8868,Aang,but  in my vision  i felt so sure she was in trouble ,40,1
4420,8870,Sokka,see  aang  shes with suki  theyre probably back at our apartment right now talking about make up or something ,40,2
4421,8871,Aang,okay  maybe youre right ,40,2
4422,8876,Katara,zuko ,40,1
4423,8878,Aang,momo ,40,1
4424,8880,Toph,theres no one else here ,40,1
4425,8881,Aang,katara is in trouble  i knew it ,40,1
4426,8882,Sokka,oh  no ,40,1
4427,8883,Toph,wait  someones at the door    actually  i know who it is  its an old friend of mine    glad to see youre okay ,40,3
4428,8884,Iroh,i need your help ,40,1
4429,8886,Aang,you guys know each other ,40,1
4430,8887,Toph,i met him in the woods once and knocked him down    then he gave me some tea and some very good advice ,40,0
4431,8888,Iroh,may i come in    princess azula is here in ba sing se ,40,3
4432,8889,Aang,she must have katara ,40,3
4433,8890,Iroh,she has captured my nephew as well ,40,3
4434,8891,Aang,then well work together to fight azula  and save katara and zuko ,40,3
4435,8892,Sokka,  whoa there  you lost me at  zuko  ,40,1
4436,8893,Iroh,i know how you must feel about my nephew    but believe me when i tell you that there is good inside him ,40,0
4437,8894,Sokka,   good inside him  isnt enough  why dont you come back when its outside him too  okay ,40,0
4438,8895,Aang,kataras in trouble  all of ba sing se is in trouble  working together is our best chance ,40,0
4439,8897,Iroh,i brought someone along who might help us ,40,2
4440,8900,Sokka,my sister  where are they keeping katara ,40,3
4441,8907,Katara,why did they throw you in here    oh  wait  let me guess  its a trap  so that when aang shows up to help me  you can finally have him in your little fire nation clutches ,40,1
4442,8909,Katara,  youre a terrible person  you know that  always following us  hunting the avatar  trying to capture the worlds last hope for peace  but what do you care  youre the fire lords son  spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood ,40,1
4443,8910,Zuko,  you dont know what youre talking about ,40,1
4444,8911,Katara,  i dont  how dare you  you have no idea what this war has put me through    me personally    the fire nation took my mother away from me ,40,3
4445,8912,Zuko,  im sorry    thats something we have in common ,40,1
4446,8914,Toph,well  whatd you know  there is an ancient city down there  but its deep ,40,1
4447,8916,Sokka,we should split up  aang  you go with iroh to look for katara and the angry jerk    no offense ,40,3
4448,8917,Iroh,  none taken ,40,1
4449,8918,Sokka,and ill go with toph to warn the earth king of azulas coup ,40,3
4450,8920,Aang,so  toph thinks you give pretty good advice  and great tea ,40,0
4451,8921,Iroh,the key to both is proper aging  whats on your mind ,40,3
4452,8923,Aang,well  i met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the avatar state and control this great power  but to do it  i had to let go of someone i love    and i just couldnt ,40,3
4453,8924,Iroh,perfection and power are overrated  i think you were very wise to choose happiness and love ,40,0
4454,8925,Aang,  what happens if we cant save anyone and beat azula  without the avatar state  what if im not powerful enough ,40,3
4455,8926,Iroh,i dont know the answer  sometimes  life is like this dark tunnel  you cant always see the light at the end of the tunnel  but if you just keep moving    you will come to a better place ,40,1
4456,8928,Sokka,theres general how ,40,1
4457,8932,Sokka,the coup is happening right now  weve gotta warn the earth king ,40,3
4458,8934,Sokka,thank goodness were in time ,40,0
4459,8937,Sokka,  uh  im kinda involved with suki ,40,1
4460,8940,Toph,theyre not the real kyoshi warriors ,40,3
4461,8946,Azula,  this fight is over ,40,3
4462,8948,Azula,get them all out of my sight ,40,3
4463,8951,Azula,its because they havent made up their minds    theyre waiting to see how this is going to end ,40,1
4464,8953,Azula,i can see your whole history in your eyes  you were born with nothing  so youve had to struggle  and connive  and claw your way to power  but true power  the divine right to rule  is something youre born with  the fact is  they dont know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne  and which one is going to be bowing down    but i know  and you know    well ,40,3
4465,8955,Azula,dont flatter yourself  you were never even a player ,40,3
4466,8957,Katara,  im sorry i yelled at you before ,40,1
4467,8958,Zuko,it doesnt matter ,40,1
4468,8959,Katara,its just that for so long now  whenever i would imagine the face of the enemy  it was your face ,40,1
4469,8960,Zuko,my face  i see   ,40,1
4470,8961,Katara,no  no  thats thats not what i mean   ,40,1
4471,8962,Zuko,its okay  i used to think this scar marked me  the mark of the banished prince  cursed to chase the avatar forever  but lately  ive realized im free to determine my own destiny  even if ill never be free of my mark ,40,3
4472,8963,Katara,maybe you could be free of it ,40,2
4473,8964,Zuko,what ,40,1
4474,8965,Katara,i have healing abilities ,40,3
4475,8966,Zuko,its a scar  it cant be healed ,40,3
4476,8967,Katara,  this is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole  it has special properties  so ive been saving it for something important    i dont know if it would work  but    ,40,3
4477,8969,Katara,aang ,40,1
4478,8971,Katara,aang  i knew you would come   ,40,1
4479,8972,Zuko,uncle  i dont understand  what are you doing with the avatar   ,40,1
4480,8973,Aang,saving you  thats what ,40,1
4481,8975,Iroh,zuko  its time we talked    go help you other friends  well catch up with you   ,40,1
4482,8976,Zuko,  why  uncle ,40,1
4483,8977,Iroh,youre not the man you used to be  zuko    you are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been  and now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny    its time for you to choose  its time for you to choose good ,40,0
4484,8979,Azula,i expected this kind of treachery from uncle    but zuko  prince zuko  youre a lot of things  but youre not a traitor  are you ,40,3
4485,8980,Zuko,release him immediately ,40,3
4486,8981,Azula,its not too late for you  zuko  you can still redeem yourself ,40,1
4487,8982,Iroh,  the kind of redemption she offers is not for you ,40,3
4488,8983,Azula,why dont you let him decide  uncle    i need you  zuko  ive plotted every move of this day    this glorious day in fire nation history  and the only way we win is together  at the end of this day  you will have your honor back  you will have fathers love  you will have everything you want ,40,3
4489,8984,Iroh,zuko  i am begging you    look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want   ,40,1
4490,8985,Azula,you are free to choose ,40,3
4491,8987,Katara,weve got to find sokka and toph ,40,1
4492,8989,Toph,see any dai li agents nearby ,40,3
4493,8990,Sokka,nope  all clear ,40,3
4494,8992,Sokka,lets go   ,40,1
4495,8995,Katara,i thought you had changed   ,40,1

4497,9000,Toph,  that is a nice trick ,40,1
4498,9006,Aang,theres too many   ,40,1
4499,9008,Aang,im sorry  katara ,40,1
4500,9010,Iroh,youve got to get out of here  ill hold them off as long as i can   ,40,3
4501,9012,Azula,weve done it  zuko  its taken a hundred years  but the fire nation has conquered ba sing se ,40,3
4502,9013,Zuko,i betrayed uncle ,40,1
4503,9014,Azula,no  he betrayed you    zuko  when you return home  father will welcome you as a war hero ,40,1
4504,9015,Zuko,but i dont have the avatar  what if father doesnt restore my honor ,40,3
4505,9016,Azula,he doesnt need to  zuko    today  you restored your own honor ,40,3
4506,9021,Aang,what happened    oh no ,41,1

4523,9050,Katara,great  great  so now you guys have finally met  so would you mind giving us a little privacy ,41,1
4524,9052,Aang,are you mad at your dad or something   ,41,1
4525,9053,Katara,  what  not at all  why would you say that ,41,1
4526,9055,Katara,maybe we should go upstairs    you need a healing session ,41,2
4527,9057,Katara,tell me where the pain feels most intense ,41,1
4528,9058,Aang,mmm  a little higher  uhhh ,41,1

4530,9061,Katara,i can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there    let me just see if i can ,41,1
4531,9063,Aang,i went down  i didnt just get hurt  did i  it was worse than that  i was gone  but you brought me back ,41,1
4532,9064,Katara,i just used the spirit water from the north pole  i dont know what i did exactly ,41,3
4533,9065,Aang,  you saved me ,41,1
4534,9066,Katara,  you need to rest ,41,3
4535,9079,Sokka,after what happened at ba sing se  we had to get you to safety  we flew back to chameleon bay where we found my father and the other water tribe men    the earth king decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise  so he set off alone    well  not completely alone    soon  the bay was overrun by fire nation ships  rather than fight them all  we captured a single ship and made it our disguise  since then weve been traveling west  we crossed through the serpents pass a few days ago  weve seen a few fire nation ships  but none have bothered us ,41,3
4536,9080,Aang,so what now ,41,1

4554,9118,Azula,who cares  the avatar is dead       unless you think he somehow miraculously survived ,41,3
4555,9120,Katara,  this is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole  it has special properties so ive been saving it for something important ,41,3
4556,9122,Zuko,no  theres no way he could have survived   ,41,3
4557,9123,Azula,well  then im sure you have nothing to worry about ,41,1
4558,9125,Toph,load the toph ,41,3
4559,9127,Katara,im gonna give us some cover ,41,1

4564,9135,Sokka,things couldnt get much worse    the universe just loves proving me wrong  doesnt it ,41,1
4565,9136,Toph,you make it too easy ,41,1
4566,9138,Sokka,thank you  the universe ,41,0

4570,9143,Aang,im not going out if i cant wear my arrow proudly   ,41,1
4571,9144,Sokka,aang  come on  be practical ,41,3
4572,9145,Katara,  you guys go ahead without us  well catch up to you    i think i understand why being a secret bothers you so much  you dont want people to think you failed ,41,1
4573,9146,Aang,youre right  i dont  but the problem is  i did fail ,41,1
4574,9147,Katara,aang  thats not true ,41,3
4575,9148,Aang,  it is true  i was in ba sing se  i was there  but i lost  and now the earth kingdom is fallen for good ,41,1
4576,9149,Katara,its not for good    remember  theres still a plan  the invasion ,41,0
4577,9150,Aang,and i hate the invasion plan  too    i dont want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes  ive always known that i would have to face the fire lord  but now i know i need to do it alone ,41,3
4578,9151,Katara,  aang    ,41,1
4579,9152,Aang,katara  please  just go     please ,41,1

4581,9154,Aang,i need to redeem myself  i need my honor back ,41,3
4582,9156,Katara,i brought you some food    oh no      ,41,1
4583,9162,Katara,he left ,41,1
4584,9164,Katara,aang  he just took his glider and disappeared  he has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone  that its all his responsibility ,41,3
4585,9166,Katara,its not brave  its selfish and stupid  we could be helping him and i know the world needs him  but doesnt he know how much we need him  too  how can he just leave us behind ,41,1
4586,9168,Katara,how could you leave us  dad    i mean  i know we had gran gran  and she loved us  but we were just so lost without you ,41,1
4587,9171,Katara,  i understand why you left  i really do  and i know that you had to go  so why do i still feel this way  im so sad and angry and hurt ,41,1
4588,9175,Zuko,  what did you hear ,41,1
4589,9178,Aang,a blockade ,41,3
4590,9180,Zuko,whyd you do it ,41,1
4591,9181,Azula,  youre going to have to be a little more specific ,41,3
4592,9182,Zuko,why did you tell father that i was the one who killed the avatar ,41,1
4593,9183,Azula,cant this wait until the morning ,41,1
4594,9184,Zuko,it  cant ,41,1
4595,9185,Azula,  fine  you seemed so worried about how father would treat you because you hadnt captured the avatar  i figured if i gave you the credit  youd have nothing to worry about ,41,1
4596,9186,Zuko,but why ,41,1
4597,9187,Azula,  call it a generous gesture  i wanted to thank you for your help and i was happy to share the glory ,41,3
4598,9188,Zuko,youre lying ,41,1
4599,9189,Azula,  if you say so    ,41,3
4600,9190,Zuko,you have another motive for doing this  i just havent figured out what it is ,41,1
4601,9191,Azula,please zuko  what ulterior motive could i have  what could i possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the avatar    unless  somehow  the avatar was actually alive  all that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness  but you said it yourself  that was impossible    sleep well  zuzu ,41,3
4602,9193,Aang,im not gonna make it  i failed    roku ,41,1
4603,9195,Aang,but everyone thinks im dead again  they think ive abandoned them  and im losing this war  im letting the whole world down ,41,1
4604,9197,Aang,i dont know ,41,1
4605,9201,Aang,  youre right  i wont give up ,41,3
4606,9203,Katara,youre okay ,41,1
4607,9205,Aang,i have so much to do ,41,1
4608,9206,Katara,i know  but youll have our help ,41,1
4609,9207,Toph,you didnt think you could get out of training just by coming to the fire nation  did you ,41,3
4610,9208,Aang,what about the invasion ,41,3
4611,9209,Sokka,well join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse ,41,3
4612,9210,Toph,  hey  whats     oh  its your glider ,41,1
4613,9211,Aang,its okay  if someone saw it  it would give away my identity  its better for now that no one knows im alive ,41,3
4614,9216,Aang,  i think i see a cave below ,42,1
4615,9217,Sokka,  sh  keep quiet ,42,1
4616,9219,Sokka,great job with the cloud camo  but next time  lets disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut   ,42,0
4617,9220,Toph,  yeah  we wouldnt want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in ,42,1
4618,9221,Sokka,  hey  were in enemy territory    those are enemy birds ,42,1
4619,9223,Sokka,well  this is it    this is how well be living until the invasion begins    hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave    ,42,3
4620,9224,Katara,  sokka  we dont need to become cave people  what we need is some new clothes ,42,1
4621,9225,Aang,yeah  blending in is better than hiding out    if we get fire nation disguises    we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave ,42,3
4622,9226,Toph,  plus  they have real food out there  does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers ,42,3
4623,9228,Sokka,looks like we got outvoted  sport  lets get some new clothes ,42,1
4624,9230,Aang,  i dont know about this    these clothes belong to somebody ,42,1

4724,9428,Toph,  too bad your skills arent on the hook ,43,1
4725,9430,Katara,it looks like well need to go somewhere else to get food    assuming thatll fit into sokkas master schedule ,43,2
4726,9431,Sokka,hmmm     its doable  but that means only two potty breaks today ,43,1
4727,9432,Aang,hey  maybe we can get food there   ,43,2
4728,9434,Aang,now you look just like a little hill with horns  bye  buddy ,43,1
4729,9436,Toph,i dont feel anything  where is the village ,43,3

4734,9447,Katara,  look at this place    its so sad    we have to do something to help ,43,1
4735,9448,Sokka,no  we cant waste our time here  we have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on  these people are on their own ,43,3
4736,9449,Katara,  these people are starving  but youd turn your back on them    how can you be so cold and heartless ,43,1
4737,9450,Sokka,  im not turning my back  im just being realistic  we cant go around helping every rinky dink town we wander into  well be helping them all by taking out the fire lord   ,43,3
4738,9451,Toph,  hey  loud mouths  maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about    taking out the fire lord  ,43,2
4739,9452,Sokka,come on  katara  be reasonable about this  you know our mission has to come first ,43,3
4740,9453,Katara,  i guess so   ,43,1
4741,9454,Aang,lets just get what we need and go   ,43,3
4742,9456,Sokka,hey  dock  you work here too ,43,1

4745,9464,Sokka,  well just take the fish    mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore   ,43,1
4746,9468,Katara,  i wish i could help more   ,43,1
4747,9470,Sokka,our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule  its gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track ,43,1
4748,9471,Toph,  finagle away  oh schedule master ,43,3
4749,9472,Sokka,well  for starters  it looks like well need to wake up forty three minutes earlier every day ,43,1
4750,9473,Katara,forty three minutes ,43,3
4751,9474,Sokka,  look  we only have a few weeks to get to the fire lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse  which  by the way  only lasts for eight minutes  and we just lost a whole day  so if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule  we have to wake up early ,43,1
4752,9475,Toph,well im not waking up early ,43,1
4753,9476,Sokka,or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks ,43,3
4754,9477,Aang,what ,43,1

5017,10071,Katara,  but  theres nothing here ,46,1
5018,10073,Toph,yes  there is  an entire village  hundreds of houses       all completely buried in ash ,46,3
5019,10075,Azula,its never too early for a sitting with the court painter  zuko  make sure he gets your good side ,46,0
5020,10076,Zuko,wait  i need to ask you something    what do you remember about our great grandfathers history ,46,1
5021,10077,Azula,  oh  zuko  its so strange how your mind works    fire lord sozin began the war  of course    he spent his early years secretly preparing for it  he was as patient as he was clever  he famously waited for the comet  later renamed sozins comet  and used its power to launch his full scale invasion of the world    in the end  he died a very old and successful man ,46,3
5022,10078,Zuko,but how did he die ,46,1
5023,10079,Azula,  didnt you pay any attention in school  zuko  he died peacefully  in his sleep    he was ancient ,46,1
5024,10081,Zuko,what does it mean ,46,1
5025,10083,Zuko,  the fire sages keep the secret history in the dragonbone catacombs ,46,3
5026,10085,Zuko,  the final testimony of fire lord sozin ,46,3
5027,10088,Aang,  wherere we going ,46,1
5028,10097,Aang,  you were friends with fire lord sozin  ,46,3
5029,10103,Aang,you dont have to tell me ,46,1
5030,10105,Aang,wait  whose party is it ,46,1
5031,10124,Katara,do they have bathrooms in the spirit world ,46,3
5032,10125,Sokka,  as a matter of fact  they do not ,46,3
5033,10127,Aang,  hey  were almost at the southern air temple ,46,2
5034,10133,Aang,no way ,46,1
5035,10137,Aang,hes air surfing  i cant believe i never thought of that ,46,1
5036,10139,Aang,  thats amazing  i cant believe you were friends with monk gyatso just like i was ,46,1
5037,10160,Aang,  roku  its that girl who didnt even know youre alive ,46,1
5038,10193,Aang,this is amazing  roku  youre battling a volcano  and youre winning ,46,0
5039,10212,Aang,whos     wait  thats me  isnt it   ,46,1
5040,10214,Aang,roku  roku ,46,1
5041,10218,Zuko,that cant be it  wheres the rest of it   ,46,3
5042,10220,Zuko,  you sent this  didnt you  i found the secret history  which by the way should be renamed history most people already know  the note said that i needed to know about my great grandfathers death  but he was still alive in the end ,46,3
5043,10221,Iroh,  no  he wasnt ,46,1
5044,10222,Zuko,  what are you talking about ,46,1
5045,10223,Iroh,you have more than one great grandfather  prince zuko  sozin was your fathers grandfather    your mothers grandfather was avatar roku ,46,3
5046,10224,Zuko,  why are you telling me this ,46,1
5047,10225,Iroh,because understanding the struggle between your two great grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself    evil and good are always at war inside you  zuko  it is your nature  your legacy  but  there is a bright side    what happened generations ago can be resolved now  by you  because of your legacy  you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the fire nation  born in you  along with all the strife  is the power to restore balance to the world ,46,0
5048,10227,Iroh,this is a royal artifact  its supposed to be worn   by the crown prince ,46,3
5049,10229,Katara,you mean  after all roku and sozin went through together  even after roku showed him mercy  sozin betrayed him like that  ,46,3
5050,10230,Toph,  its like these people are born bad ,46,1
5051,10231,Aang,  no  thats wrong  i dont think that was the point of what roku showed me at all ,46,1
5052,10232,Sokka,  then what was the point ,46,3
5053,10233,Aang,  roku was just as much fire nation as sozin was  right  if anything  their story proves anyones capable of great good and great evil    everyone  even the fire lord and the fire nation have to be treated like theyre worth giving a chance    and i also think it was about friendships ,46,0
5054,10234,Toph,  do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime ,46,3
5055,10235,Aang,  i dont see why not ,46,1
5056,10237,Sokka,well  scientifically speaking  theres no way to prove that    ,46,1
5057,10238,Katara,  oh  sokka  just hold hands ,46,1
5058,10241,Toph,  how could you do this to me  you betrayed me ,47,1

5228,10469,Katara,one winter when mom was a girl  a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks  a month later  mom noticed she hadnt seen her friend nini since the storm  so mom and some others went to check on ninis family  when they got there  no one was home    just a fire flickering in the fireplace  while the men went out to search  mom stayed in the house  when she was alone  she heard a voice     its so cold and i cant get warm     mom turned and saw nini standing by the fire  she was blue like she was frozen  mom ran outside for help  but when everyone came back  nini was gone ,48,1
5229,10471,Sokka,  whered she go ,48,1
5230,10472,Katara,no one knows  ninis house stands empty to this day  but sometimes  people see smoke coming up from the chimney  like little nini is still trying to get warm ,48,1
5231,10474,Toph,  wait  guys  did you hear that    i hear people under the mountain  and theyre screaming ,48,1
5232,10476,Sokka,pfft  nice try ,48,1

5234,10478,Katara,youre probably just jumpy from the ghost stories    ,48,2
5235,10479,Toph,it just     stopped ,48,1
5236,10480,Aang,  all right  now im getting scared ,48,1

5241,10497,Katara,that mr  yao seems to have a thing for you  maybe we should go back and see if hell give us some free komodo sausages ,48,2
5242,10505,Sokka,people disappearing in the woods  weird stuff happening during full moons  this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans ,48,1
5243,10506,Aang,i bet if we take a little walk around town  well find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad ,48,1
5244,10507,Sokka,  and then you can sew up this little mystery lickety split  avatar style ,48,3
5245,10508,Aang,  helping people     thats what i do ,48,1
5246,10511,Sokka,  this is a mysterious little town you have here ,48,1
5247,10514,Sokka,that hama seems a little strange  like she knows something  or shes hiding something ,48,3
5248,10515,Katara,  thats ridiculous  shes a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay    she kinda reminds me of gran gran ,48,1
5249,10516,Sokka,but what did she mean by that comment   mysterious children  ,48,1
5250,10517,Katara,gee  i dont know  maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night  isnt that a little mysterious ,48,2
5251,10518,Sokka,im gonna take a look around   ,48,1
5252,10519,Katara,  sokka  sokka  what are you doing    you cant just snoop around someones house ,48,1

5259,10527,Sokka,just an ordinary puppet loving innkeeper  huh  well then why does she have a locked door up here ,48,3
5260,10528,Katara,  probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff ,48,2
5261,10529,Sokka,well see    its empty  except for a little chest ,48,1
5262,10530,Toph,maybe its treasure ,48,2

5267,10538,Toph,ooh  hand it over ,48,1
5268,10540,Sokka,  come on  come on ,48,1

5280,10562,Aang,  id steer clear of the sea prunes ,48,3
5281,10563,Toph,i thought they were ocean kumquats ,48,3

5290,10596,Katara,ive even used my own sweat for waterbending ,48,3
5291,10601,Aang,this has got to be the nicest natural setting in the fire nation  i dont see anything that would make a spirit mad around here ,48,1
5292,10603,Toph,maybe the moon spirit just turned mean ,48,2
5293,10604,Sokka,  the moon spirit is a gentle  loving lady  she rules the sky with compassion and     lunar goodness ,48,3
5294,10605,Aang,  excuse me  sir  can you tell us anything about the spirit thats been stealing people ,48,3
5295,10607,Toph,where does old man ding live ,48,1

5297,10611,Katara,i met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside ,48,3
5298,10614,Katara,that was incredible    its a shame about the lilies  though ,48,0
5299,10616,Katara,  but isnt that dangerous  i thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon ,48,3
5300,10619,Aang,old man ding ,48,1

5529,11072,Katara,no offense sokka  but youre not exactly mr  healing hands ,50,3
5530,11073,Sokka,no    ill lead the invasion force ,50,3
5531,11074,Katara,dont be crazy sokka ,50,1
5532,11075,Sokka,maybe i am a little crazy  but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does ,50,2
5533,11077,Katara,i still think youre crazy  but im proud of you too ,50,1
5534,11078,Sokka,  yip yip ,50,1
5535,11080,Sokka,listen up  everyone  i want the tanks in wedge formation  warriors and benders in the middle  were taking that tower  and heading for the royal palace    charge ,50,3
5536,11082,Aang,  thats strange    the avatar is back    hello  anyone home ,50,3
5537,11087,Aang,no    no  no  no  fire lord ozai  where are you  ,50,3
5538,11090,Sokka,  dad    youre on your feet again ,51,1
5539,11092,Sokka,everythings going smoothly and the eclipse hasnt even kicked in yet ,51,3
5540,11094,Katara,  yeah  is that     is that aang ,51,3
5541,11095,Sokka,  what    please tell me youre here because the fire lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didnt even need the eclipse to take him down ,51,3
5542,11096,Aang,  he wasnt home  no one was  the entire palace city is abandoned ,51,1
5543,11097,Sokka,  they knew ,51,3
5544,11099,Aang,  its over  the fire lord is probably long gone  far away on some remote island where hell be safe during the eclipse ,51,2
5545,11100,Sokka,  no  my instincts tell me he wouldnt go too far  he would have a secret bunker  somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation ,51,2
5546,11101,Toph,if its an underground secret bunker were looking for    im just the girl to find it ,51,3
5547,11102,Sokka,  the mechanist gave me this timing device  it looks like weve got about ten minutes until the full eclipse  ten minutes to find the fire lord ,51,3
5548,11103,Aang,we can still do this  we can still win the day ,51,3
5549,11104,Katara,  wait  if they knew we were coming it could all be a trap    maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely ,51,2
5550,11106,Sokka,  what do you think  youre the one that has to face the fire lord  whatever you decide  im with you ,51,3
5551,11107,Aang,  ive gotta try ,51,1
5552,11109,Aang,do you feel anything down there ,51,1
5553,11110,Toph,  yep  there are natural tunnels criss crossing through the inside of the volcano ,51,3
5554,11111,Sokka,anything else  is there a structure somewhere ,51,2
5555,11112,Toph,  there is something big  dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano ,51,3
5556,11113,Sokka,  sounds like a secret bunker to me ,51,3
5557,11115,Aang,  stay safe  well be back soon ,51,3
5558,11117,Toph,  this way  that ones a dead end ,51,3
5559,11118,Sokka,  what would we do without you ,51,1
5560,11119,Toph,  perish in burning hot magma ,51,3
5561,11120,Sokka,  yeah  pretty much ,51,1
5562,11122,Toph,the tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker ,51,3
5563,11123,Sokka,well have to be fast  but careful ,51,3
5564,11125,Aang,how is that careful ,51,1
5565,11126,Sokka,i was wrong  we need to be fast  careful and lucky ,51,1
5566,11128,Sokka,theres no floor  its just a river of lava ,51,3
5567,11129,Aang,  climb aboard and hold on tight ,51,3
5568,11131,Sokka,  thats some door ,51,1
5569,11132,Toph,  not a problem ,51,1
5570,11134,Sokka,  i am so glad we added you to the group ,51,3
5571,11140,Katara,  we can wait here if you want ,51,3
5572,11144,Aang,  thanks ,51,0
5573,11146,Sokka,only thirty seconds until the total eclipse ,51,3
5574,11148,Aang,im ready  im ready to face the fire lord ,51,3
5575,11150,Azula,so  you are alive after all    i had a hunch that you survived  but it doesnt matter    ive known about the invasion for months ,51,3
5576,11152,Zuko,  im ready to face you ,51,3
5577,11159,Zuko,im here to tell the truth ,51,1
5578,11162,Zuko,first of all  in ba sing se  it was azula who took down the avatar  not me ,51,3
5579,11164,Zuko,because the avatars not dead  he survived ,51,3
5580,11166,Zuko,in fact  hes probably leading this invasion  he could be on his way here right now ,51,2
5581,11168,Zuko,thats another thing  im not taking orders from you anymore ,51,1
5582,11170,Zuko,  think again  i am going to speak my mind  and you are going to listen ,51,3
5583,11172,Aang,where is he  wheres the fire lord ,51,3
5584,11173,Azula,  you mean im not good enough for you    youre hurting my feelings ,51,0
5585,11174,Sokka,stop wasting our time and give us the information    youre powerless right now  so youre in no position to refuse ,51,3
5586,11175,Toph,  and stick to the truth  ill be able to tell if youre lying ,51,3
5587,11176,Azula,  are you sure  im a pretty good liar    i am a four hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings ,51,0
5588,11177,Toph,  okay  youre good  i admit it    but you ought to consider telling the truth anyway ,51,0
5589,11179,Azula,  when i left ba sing se i brought home some souvenirs  dai li agents ,51,1
5590,11187,Katara,  its not over yet ,51,3
5591,11189,Zuko,for so long  all i wanted was for you to love me  to accept me  i thought it was my honor i wanted  but really  i was just trying to please you  you  my father  who banished me just for talking out of turn    my father  who challenged me  a thirteen year old boy  to an agni kai    how could you possibly justify a duel with a child ,51,3
5592,11191,Zuko,it was cruel  and it was wrong ,51,1
5593,11193,Zuko,no  ive learned everything  and ive had to learn it on my own  growing up  we were taught that the fire nation was the greatest civilization in history  and somehow  the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world  what an amazing lie that was  the people of the world are terrified by the fire nation  they dont see our greatness  they hate us  and we deserve it    weve created an era of fear in the world  and if we dont want the world to destroy itself    we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness ,51,3
5594,11195,Zuko,yes    he has ,51,3
5595,11197,Aang,  i cant pin her down  shes too quick ,51,1
5596,11199,Sokka,  wait  aang  toph  stop attacking  dont you see what shes doing  shes just playing with us  shes not even trying to win this fight ,51,1
5597,11200,Azula,  not true  im giving it my all ,51,1
5598,11201,Toph,  youre trying to keep us here and waste all our time ,51,1
5599,11202,Azula,  um  right  i think your friend just said that  genius  and since you cant see  i should tell you im rolling my eyes   ,51,1
5600,11203,Toph,  ill roll your whole head ,51,1
5601,11204,Sokka,shes just baiting you again ,51,1
5602,11205,Aang,okay  so what do we do  just ignore her ,51,1
5603,11206,Sokka,we dont have a choice  we just have to get out of here and find the fire lord on our own somehow ,51,3
5604,11208,Azula,  its a trap  dont say i didnt warn you ,51,1
5605,11210,Sokka,  ignore ,51,3
5606,11211,Azula,  so  sokkas your name  right  my favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time    she was convinced you were going to come rescue her  of course you never came  and she gave up on you ,51,3
5607,11213,Azula,  come and get it ,51,1
5608,11215,Sokka,where  is  suki  ,51,1

5610,11219,Zuko,but ive come to an even more important decision    im going to join the avatar and im going to help him defeat you ,51,3
5611,11221,Zuko,because i know my own destiny  taking you down is the avatars destiny    goodbye ,51,0
5612,11224,Zuko,what happened that night ,51,1
5613,11227,Sokka,wheres suki  answer me ,51,1

5620,11240,Toph,its not your fault  sokka  azula was ready for us  she had every move planned out ,51,3
5621,11241,Sokka,  and now its too late ,51,1
5622,11242,Aang,maybe its not too late  the eclipse is over  but i can face the fire lord anyway ,51,2
5623,11243,Sokka,  no  i dont think thats a good idea ,51,0
5624,11244,Aang,but im ready  i came here with a job to do and everyones counting on me ,51,1
5625,11245,Toph,the fire lord knew we were coming this time  we thought we had surprise on our side but we didnt  it just wasnt our day  what we need to do now is go and help our friends ,51,3
5626,11246,Aang,  i guess you guys are right ,51,1
5627,11247,Sokka,  youll have another chance  i know you will ,51,1
5628,11254,Katara,theyre back ,51,1
5629,11256,Sokka,  it was all a trap  azula knew we were coming and shes plotted out every move    weve just got to get to the beach as fast as we can    if we can make it to the submarines  maybe we can get away safely ,51,2
5630,11257,Aang,theyve got air power  but so do i    im gonna do what i can to slow them down   ,51,1
5631,11258,Katara,appa  you and i can help too   ,51,1
5632,11260,Sokka,everyone  lets get back to the subs   ,51,1
5633,11262,Katara,we cant keep them all back  theres too many of them ,51,3
5634,11263,Aang,lets join the others   ,51,3
5635,11265,Zuko,uncle    where is my uncle ,51,3
5636,11268,Sokka,try and find cover  i think were about to see some bombs ,51,3
5637,11270,Katara,why arent they turning around to attack us again ,51,1
5638,11271,Aang,  theyre heading for the beach       theyre gonna destroy the submarines ,51,3
5639,11272,Sokka,  how are we all going to escape ,51,1
5640,11274,Sokka,  then our only choice is to stand and fight  we have the avatar  we could still win ,51,3
5641,11276,Katara,  what    we cant leave you behind    we wont leave anyone behind ,51,1
5642,11280,Sokka,  theyre at the beach already ,51,1
5643,11291,Katara,well miss you  dad   ,51,1
5644,11292,Sokka,bye  dad  we wont be apart for too long this time  i promise ,51,1
5645,11294,Aang,thank you all for being so brave and so strong  im gonna make this up to you ,51,0
5646,11297,Azula,no  theyre too fast  it doesnt matter  theyll be back   ,51,1
5647,11298,Aang,  i know just the place for us to go where well be safe for a while  the western air temple ,51,3
5648,11301,Katara,this is humiliating ,52,1
5649,11302,Sokka,  you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the fire nation or having to walk all the way to the western air temple ,52,3
5650,11303,Katara,  both ,52,1
5651,11305,Aang,  sorry guys  but appa gets tired carrying all these people ,52,1
5652,11311,Sokka,i miss not having blisters on my feet ,52,1
5653,11313,Toph,hey  were here  i can feel it ,52,1
5654,11315,Katara,uhhh     i think your feet need their eyes checked ,52,1
5655,11317,Aang,no  shes right  we are here ,52,3
5656,11319,Toph,wow     its amazing ,52,1
5657,11321,Iroh,what a stunning view ,52,1
5658,11323,Zuko,the only view im interested in seeing is the avatar in chains ,52,3
5659,11324,Iroh,you know  the avatar hasnt been seen for one hundred years  the chances of finding him here are very slim   ,52,3
5660,11325,Zuko,  first well check each of the air temples  then well scour the world  searching even the most remote locations until we find him ,52,3
5661,11326,Iroh,prince zuko  its only been a week since your banishment  you should take some time to heal and rest ,52,1
5662,11327,Zuko,what else would i expect to hear from the laziest man in the fire nation    the only way to regain my honor is to find the avatar  so i will ,52,3
5663,11332,Katara,you guys go  i think we need to talk about some things ,52,1
5664,11336,Aang,why cant i go ,52,1
5665,11337,Katara,we need to decide what were gonna do now  and since youre the avatar  maybe you should be a part of this ,52,2
5666,11338,Aang,  fair enough  so  whats the new plan ,52,3
5667,11339,Sokka,well  if you ask me  the new plan is the old plan  you just need to master all four elements and confront the fire lord before the comet comes ,52,3
5668,11340,Aang,  oh  yeah  thats great  no problem  ill just do that ,52,1
5669,11341,Katara,aang  no one said its going to be easy ,52,1
5670,11342,Aang,well  its not even gonna be possible  where am i supposed to get a firebending teacher ,52,2
5671,11343,Katara,we could look for jeong jeong ,52,3
5672,11344,Aang,  yeah     right    like well ever run into jeong jeong again ,52,3
5673,11345,Toph,  whos     oh    never mind  if its important ill find out ,52,1
5674,11346,Aang,oh well  guess we cant come up with anybody  why dont we just take a nice tour around the temple   ,52,1
5675,11347,Toph,whats up with him ,52,1
5676,11348,Sokka,theres gotta be someone who can teach him firebending ,52,3
5677,11350,Zuko,hello       zuko here  but i guess   you probably already know me  sort of  uhhh     so  the thing is i have a lot of firebending experience  and im   considered to be pretty good at it    well  youve seen me  you know  when i was attacking you    uhhh     yeah  i guess   i should apologize for that  but anyway    im good now    i mean  i thought i was good before  but i realize i was bad    but anyway  i think its time i joined your group and taught   the avatar firebending    well  whats your answer    yeah     thats what id say  too  how am i supposed to convince these people that im on their side  what would uncle do    zuko  you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self  only then will your true self  reveal itself    even when im talking for him i cant figure out what he means  what would azula do    listen  avatar  i can join your group  or i can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends  your choice    i guess im just not that good at impersonations ,52,2
5678,11352,Katara,aang  can we talk about you learning firebending now ,52,3
5679,11353,Aang,what  the wind is too loud in my ears  check out this loop ,52,1
5680,11355,Sokka,aang  i think we should be making some plans about our future ,52,3
5681,11356,Aang,okay  we can do that while i show you the giant pai sho table  oh  youre gonna love the all day echo chamber ,52,3
5682,11357,Toph,  i think thatll have to wait ,52,1
5683,11359,Zuko,  hello       zuko here ,52,1
5684,11361,Zuko,hey  i heard you guys flying around down there  so  i just thought id wait for you here    i know you must be surprised to see me here ,52,1
5685,11362,Sokka,not really  since youve followed us all over the world ,52,3
5686,11363,Zuko,right  well  uhhh     anyway     what i wanted to tell you about is that ive changed  and i  uhhh  im good now  and well i think i should join your group  oh  and i can teach firebending to you    see  i  uhhh    ,52,0
5687,11364,Toph,you want to what now ,52,1
5688,11365,Katara,you cant possibly think that any of us would trust you  can you  i mean  how stupid do you think we are  ,52,3
5689,11366,Sokka,yeah  all youve ever done is hunt us down and try to capture aang ,52,3
5690,11367,Zuko,ive done some good things  i mean  i could have stolen your bison in ba sing se  but i set him free  thats something   ,52,0
5691,11368,Toph,appa   does seem to like him ,52,1
5692,11369,Sokka,he probably just covered himself in honey or something so that appa would lick him  im not buying it ,52,2
5693,11370,Zuko,i can understand why you wouldnt trust me  and i know ive made some mistakes in the past ,52,1
5694,11371,Sokka,like when you attacked our village ,52,1
5695,11372,Katara,or when you stole my mothers necklace and used it to track us down and capture us ,52,3
5696,11373,Zuko,look  i admit ive some awful things  i was wrong to try to capture you  and im sorry that i attacked the water tribe  and i never should have sent that fire nation assassin after you    im going to try and stop ,52,1
5697,11374,Sokka,  wait  you sent combustion man after us ,52,3
5698,11375,Zuko,well  thats not his name  but ,52,1
5699,11376,Sokka,  ohhh  sorry  i didnt mean to insult your friend ,52,1
5700,11377,Zuko,  hes not my friend ,52,3
5701,11378,Toph,that guy locked me and katara in jail and tried to blow us all up ,52,3
5702,11379,Zuko,  why arent you saying anything  you once said you thought we could be friends  you know i have good in me ,52,0
5703,11381,Aang,theres no way we can trust you after everything youve done  well never let you join us ,52,3
5704,11382,Katara,you need to get out of here  now ,52,1
5705,11383,Zuko,im trying to explain that im not that person anymore ,52,1
5706,11384,Sokka,either you leave  or we attack ,52,3
5707,11385,Zuko,if you wont accept me as a friend  then maybe youll take me as a prisoner   ,52,2
5708,11386,Katara,no  we wont    get out of here  and dont come back  and if we ever see you again  well  wed better not see you again ,52,3
5709,11388,Zuko,uggh  i cant believe how stupid i am  i mean  what was i thinking  telling them i sent an assassin after them  why didnt i just say azula did that  they would have believed that  stupid    uggh ,52,1
5710,11390,Katara,why would he try to fool us like that ,52,1
5711,11391,Sokka,obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap ,52,3
5712,11392,Katara,this is just like when we were in prison together at ba sing se  he starts talking about his mother and making it seem like hes an actual human being with feelings ,52,3
5713,11393,Sokka,he wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down  then he strikes ,52,3
5714,11394,Katara,the thing is  it worked  i did feel sorry for him  i felt like he was really confused and hurt  but obviously  when the time came  he made his choice  and we paid the price  we cant trust him ,52,3
5715,11395,Aang,i kind of have a confession to make  remember when you two were sick and i got captured by zhao ,52,1
5716,11396,Sokka,and you made us suck on frozen frogs  how could i forget  i had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month ,52,1
5717,11397,Katara,sokka  i looked at it  and i told you  there was nothing there ,52,1
5718,11398,Sokka,i could feel it  its my throatal flap ,52,1
5719,11399,Aang,anyway  when zhao had me chained up  it was zuko who came in and got me out  he risked his life to save me ,52,3
5720,11400,Katara,no way  im sure he only did it so he could capture you himself ,52,3
5721,11401,Sokka,yeah  face it aang  youre nothing but a big prize to him ,52,3
5722,11402,Aang,youre probably right ,52,2
5723,11403,Katara,and what was all that crazy stuff about setting appa free  what a liar ,52,1
5724,11404,Toph,actually  he wasnt lying ,52,1
5725,11405,Sokka,  oh  hooray  in a lifetime of evil  at least he didnt add animal cruelty to the list ,52,1
5726,11406,Toph,im just saying that  considering his messed up family and how he was raised  he could have turned out a lot worse ,52,1
5727,11407,Katara,  youre right  toph  lets go find him and give him a medal  the  not as much of a jerk as you could have been  award ,52,3
5728,11408,Toph,all i know is that while he was talking to us  he was sincere  maybe youre all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly ,52,2
5729,11409,Katara,easy for you to say  you werent there when he had us attacked by pirates ,52,1
5730,11410,Sokka,or when he burned down kyoshi island ,52,3
5731,11411,Aang,or when he tried to capture me at the fire temple ,52,3
5732,11412,Katara,why would you even try to defend him ,52,1
5733,11413,Toph,  because katara  youre all ignoring one crucial fact    aang needs a firebending teacher  we cant think of a single person in the world to do the job  now one shows up on a silver platter  and you wont even think about it   ,52,3
5734,11414,Aang,im not having zuko as my teacher ,52,1
5735,11415,Sokka,youre darn right youre not  buddy ,52,1
5736,11416,Katara,well  i guess that settles that ,52,1
5737,11417,Toph,ergh  im beginning to wonder whos really the blind one around here   ,52,1
5738,11419,Zuko,whos there  stay back   ,52,1
5739,11420,Toph,its me    ow  you burned my feet ,52,1
5740,11421,Zuko,im sorry  it was a mistake   ,52,1
5741,11422,Toph,get away from me   ,52,1
5742,11423,Zuko,let me help you    im sorry   ,52,1
5743,11424,Toph,get off me  get off me   ,52,3
5744,11425,Zuko,i didnt know it was you  uggh  come back    uggh  why am i so bad at being good ,52,1
5745,11427,Katara,  has anyone seen toph ,52,3
5746,11428,Sokka,i havent seen her since she stormed off yesterday ,52,1
5747,11430,Katara,i think we should go look for her ,52,1
5748,11431,Sokka,  let her have fun with her rocks  im in no rush to have her yelling at us again ,52,1
5749,11436,Katara,  toph  what happened ,52,1
5750,11437,Toph,my feet got burned ,52,1
5751,11438,Katara,oh no  what happened ,52,1
5752,11439,Toph,i just told you  my feet got burned ,52,1
5753,11440,Katara,i meant  how ,52,1
5754,11441,Toph,well  i kind of went to see zuko last night   ,52,1
5755,11442,Aang,you what ,52,1
5756,11443,Katara,zuko ,52,1
5757,11444,Sokka,uhhh     ,52,1
5758,11445,Toph,i thought he could be helpful to us    and if i talked to him  maybe we could work something out ,52,2
5759,11446,Sokka,so he attacked you ,52,1
5760,11447,Toph,well  he did  and he didnt  it was sort of an accident ,52,1
5761,11448,Aang,but he did firebend at you ,52,1
5762,11449,Toph,  yes ,52,1
5763,11450,Sokka,see  you trusted zuko  and you got burned  literally ,52,3
5764,11451,Katara,its gonna take a while for your feet to get better    i wish i could have worked on them sooner ,52,1
5765,11452,Toph,yeah  me too ,52,1
5766,11453,Sokka,zukos clearly too dangerous to be left alone  were gonna have to go after him ,52,3
5767,11454,Aang,i hate to go looking for a fight  but youre right  after what he did to toph  i dont think we have a choice ,52,1
5768,11455,Sokka,hes crafty  but well find a way to capture him ,52,3
5769,11456,Toph,maybe just invite him back here    hes already offered himself up as a prisoner once ,52,2
5770,11457,Sokka,yeah  get him to come back and say hell be our prisoner  then well jump him and really make him our prisoner  hell never suspect it   ,52,3
5771,11458,Katara,  you are a master of surprise  sokka    ,52,3
5772,11460,Toph,ahhh  thats the stuff  now i know how the rest of you guys feel  not being able to see with your feet stinks   ,52,1
5773,11462,Zuko,stop    i dont want you hunting the avatar anymore    the mission is off  im ordering you to stop ,52,1
5774,11464,Zuko,if you keep attacking  i wont pay you    all right  ill pay you double to stop ,52,3
5775,11466,Toph,hes going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side ,52,3
5776,11468,Katara,i cant step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and i cant get a good enough angle on him from down here ,52,0
5777,11469,Sokka,  i know how to get an angle on him    all right buddy  dont fail me now   ,52,3
5778,11471,Sokka,yeah  boomerang    awww  boomerang    ,52,1
5779,11474,Aang,i cant believe im saying this  but     thanks  zuko ,52,0
5780,11475,Sokka,hey  what about me  i did the boomerang thing ,52,1
5781,11476,Zuko,listen  i know i didnt explain myself very well yesterday  ive been through a lot in the last few years  and its been hard  but im realizing that i had to go through all those things to learn the truth  i thought i had lost my honor  and that somehow my father could return it to me  but i know now that no one can give you your honor  its something you earn for yourself  by choosing to do whats right  all i want to do now is play my part in ending this war  and i know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world    im sorry for what i did to you    it was an accident  fire can be dangerous and wild  so as a firebender  i need to be more careful and control my bending  so i dont hurt people unintentionally ,52,1
5782,11477,Aang,  i think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher  when i first tried to learn firebending  i burned katara  and after that  i never wanted to firebend again  but now i know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love  id like you to teach me   ,52,1
5783,11478,Zuko,  thank you  im so happy youve accepted me into your group ,52,0
5784,11479,Aang,not so fast  i still have to ask my friends if its okay with them    toph  youre the one that zuko burned  what do you think ,52,1
5785,11480,Toph,go ahead and let him join    itll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet ,52,3
5786,11481,Aang,  sokka ,52,1
5787,11482,Sokka,  hey  all i want is to defeat the fire lord  if you think this is the way to do it  then  im all for it ,52,3
5788,11483,Aang,  katara ,52,1
5789,11484,Katara,  ill go along with whatever you think is right   ,52,3
5790,11485,Zuko,  i wont let you down  i promise ,52,1
5791,11487,Sokka,so  here you go  home sweet home  i guess  you know  for now  unpack  lunch  soon  uhhh     welcome aboard    yeah    okay  this is really  really weird ,52,1
5792,11489,Zuko,if i have to  i will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the avatar  i know its my destiny to capture him ,52,3
5793,11490,Iroh,  you know prince zuko  destiny is a funny thing  you never know how things are going to work out  but if you keep an open mind  and an open heart  i promise you will find your own destiny someday ,52,3
5794,11492,Katara,you might have everyone else here buying your     transformation  but you and i both know youve struggled with doing the right thing in the past    so let me tell you something  right now  you make one step backward    one slip up  give me one reason to think you might hurt aang  and you wont have to worry about your destiny anymore    because ill make sure your destiny ends     right then and there  permanently ,52,2
5795,11496,Zuko,i know youre nervous  but remember  firebending in it of itself is not something to fear ,53,1
5796,11497,Aang,  okay  not something to fear ,53,3
5797,11498,Zuko,  but if you dont respect it    itll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino ,53,1
5798,11500,Zuko,now show me what youve got  any amount of fire you can make ,53,3
5799,11502,Aang,maybe i need a little more instruction  perhaps a demonstration ,53,2
5800,11503,Zuko,  good idea  you might wanna take a couple steps back ,53,2
5801,11505,Zuko,  what was that  that was the worst firebending ive ever seen ,53,3
5802,11506,Aang,  i thought it was     nice   ,53,1
5803,11508,Zuko,  why is this happening ,53,1
5804,11509,Aang,  maybe its the altitude ,53,2
5805,11510,Zuko,  yeah  could be ,53,3
5806,11512,Zuko,just breathe  and      ,53,1
5807,11513,Aang,  that one kind of felt hot ,53,1
5808,11514,Zuko,  dont patronize me  you know what its supposed to look like ,53,3
5809,11515,Aang,sorry  sifu hotman ,53,1
5810,11516,Zuko,  and stop calling me that ,53,1
5811,11518,Sokka,hey  jerks  mind if i watch you two jerks do your jerkbending ,53,1
5812,11519,Zuko,  get out of here   ,53,1
5813,11520,Sokka,okay  take it easy    i was just kiddin around    jerkbending  still got it   ,53,1
5814,11522,Zuko,listen everybody  ive got some pretty bad news  ive lost my stuff   ,53,1
5815,11523,Toph,  dont look at me    i didnt touch your stuff ,53,1
5816,11524,Zuko,im talking about my firebending  its gone   ,53,1
5817,11526,Katara,im sorry  im just laughing at the irony  you know  how it wouldve been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago ,53,1
5818,11527,Zuko,  well  its not lost  its just     weaker for some reason ,53,1
5819,11528,Katara,  maybe youre not as good as you think you are ,53,2
5820,11529,Toph,  ouch   ,53,1
5821,11530,Zuko,  i bet its because i changed sides ,53,1
5822,11531,Katara,  thats ridiculous   ,53,1
5823,11532,Aang,i dont know  maybe it isnt  maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just dont have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to ,53,2
5824,11533,Sokka,  sooo  all we need to do is make zuko angry  easy enough ,53,3
5825,11535,Zuko,okay  cut it out    look  even if youre right  i dont want to rely on hate and anger anymore  there has to be another way ,53,1
5826,11536,Toph,  youre gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source  i recommend the original source   ,53,3
5827,11537,Sokka,  hows he supposed to do that   by jumping into a volcano  ,53,3
5828,11538,Toph,no  zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is ,53,3
5829,11539,Sokka,  so  is it jumping into a volcano ,53,1
5830,11540,Toph,i dont know    for earthbending  the original benders were badgermoles ,53,3
5831,11542,Toph,  one day  when i was little  i ran away and hid in a cave ,53,1
5832,11544,Toph,thats where i met them ,53,1
5833,11546,Toph,they were blind  just like me    so we understood each other  i was able to learn earthbending    not just as a martial art  but as an extension of my senses    for them  the original earthbenders    it wasnt just about fighting  it was their way of interacting with the world   ,53,3
5834,11548,Aang,thats amazing  toph ,53,1
5835,11549,Aang,  i learned from the monks  but the original airbenders were the sky bison    maybe you can give me a lesson sometime  buddy ,53,2
5836,11551,Zuko,well  this doesnt help me  the original firebenders were the dragons  and theyre extinct ,53,3
5837,11552,Aang,  what do you mean   roku had a dragon  and there were plenty of dragons when i was a kid ,53,1
5838,11553,Zuko,  well  they arent around anymore  okay ,53,1
5839,11554,Aang,okay  okay    im sorry ,53,1
5840,11555,Zuko,but maybe theres another way    the first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient sun warriors ,53,2
5841,11556,Aang,  sun warriors  well  i know they werent around when i was a kid ,53,1
5842,11557,Zuko,  no  they died off thousands of years ago  but their civilization wasnt too far from where we are now    maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins ,53,2
5843,11558,Aang,its like the monks used to tell me  sometimes  the shadows of the past can be felt by the present ,53,3
5844,11559,Sokka,so  what    maybe youll pick up some super old sun warrior energy just by standing   where they stood a thousand years ago ,53,2
5845,11560,Zuko,  more or less  either i find a new way to firebend    or the avatar has to find a new teacher   ,53,3
5846,11562,Zuko,weve been riding for hours  i dont know why  but i thought this thing would be a lot faster ,53,1
5847,11564,Aang,  appas right  zuko  in our group  typically we start our missions with a more up beat attitude ,53,3
5848,11565,Zuko,  i cant believe this   ,53,1
5849,11566,Aang,  dont worry  youll get the hang of it ,53,1
5850,11568,Aang and Zuko,whoa ,53,1
5851,11570,Zuko,even though these buildings are ancient  theres something eerily familiar about them    i can tell the fire sages temples are somehow descended from these ,53,3
5852,11571,Aang,  okay  weve learned something about architecture    hopefully  well learn something about firebending too  the past can be a great teacher ,53,3
5853,11573,Aang,  zuko  i think the past is trying to kill me ,53,1
5854,11574,Zuko,  i cant believe it    this booby trap must be centuries old and it still works ,53,3
5855,11575,Aang,theres probably a lot more  maybe this means we shouldnt be here ,53,2
5856,11577,Zuko,  wheres that up beat attitude you were talkin about    besides  people dont make traps unless theyve got something worth protecting ,53,1
5857,11579,Aang,look  this seems promising    though im not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending ,53,3
5858,11580,Zuko,  they look pretty angry to me ,53,1
5859,11581,Aang,  i thought the dragons were friends with the sun warriors ,53,3
5860,11582,Zuko,well  they had a funny way of showing it ,53,1
5861,11584,Aang,zuko    something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years    something youre not telling me ,53,1
5862,11585,Zuko,  my great grandfather sozin happened ,53,1
5863,11587,Zuko,he started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory  there were the ultimate firebenders    and if you could conquer one  your firebending talents would become legendary and youd earn the honorary title  dragon    the last great dragon was conquered long before i was born    by my uncle ,53,3
5864,11588,Aang,  but i thought your uncle was     i dont know  good ,53,0
5865,11589,Zuko,he had a complicated past    family tradition  i guess  lets just move on ,53,3
5866,11591,Aang,its locked up ,53,3
5867,11593,Zuko,wait    its a celestial calendar    just like the fire sages have in their temples    i bet that sunstone opens the door  but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle    on the solstice ,53,3
5868,11594,Aang,  monkeyfeathers  the solstice again  we cant wait here that long ,53,3
5869,11595,Zuko,  no  we cant    but we might be able to speed time up    lets see if we can outsmart the sunstone ,53,2
5870,11597,Aang,nothings happening ,53,1
5871,11598,Zuko,  come on    ,53,1
5872,11600,Aang,  you know  zuko  i dont care what everyone else says about you    youre pretty smart ,53,1
5873,11602,Zuko,relax  theyre just statues ,53,1
5874,11604,Aang,it says this is something called the dancing dragon ,53,1
5875,11606,Aang,zuko  get over here  i want you to dance with me ,53,1
5876,11607,Zuko,  what ,53,1
5877,11608,Aang,just do it ,53,1
5878,11610,Aang,lets follow the steps of the statues    dont you see  these arent dance moves  these statues are giving us a lesson    i think this is some kind of sun warrior firebending form ,53,3
5879,11611,Zuko,this better teach us some really good firebending ,53,0
5880,11613,Aang,hurray    wait  what exactly is that ,53,3
5881,11614,Zuko,  its some kind of mystical gemstone ,53,3
5882,11615,Aang,  well  dont touch it   ,53,1
5883,11616,Zuko,why not ,53,1
5884,11617,Aang,remember what happened out there with those spikes    im just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals ,53,1
5885,11619,Zuko,it feels almost alive ,53,2
5886,11621,Aang,  oh no  its another trap ,53,1
5887,11623,Zuko,ugh  i cant pull free  its like some kind of glue ,53,1
5888,11625,Aang,  i cant move  zuko  do something ,53,1
5889,11626,Zuko,me  i cant move either ,53,1
5890,11628,Aang,it stopped ,53,1
5891,11629,Zuko,at least we have air  maybe if we stay calm  we can figure a way out of this ,53,2
5892,11631,Aang,you had to pick up the glowing egg  didnt you ,53,1
5893,11632,Zuko,  at least i made something happen  if it were up to you  wed never have made it past the courtyard ,53,3
5894,11633,Aang,  help ,53,1
5895,11634,Zuko,who are you yelling to  nobodys lived here for centuries ,53,1
5896,11635,Aang,well  what do you think we should do ,53,1
5897,11636,Zuko,think about our place in the universe  ,53,1
5898,11641,Zuko,  we didnt come here to take your sunstone  we came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending ,53,3
5899,11644,Aang,please  i dont normally play this card  but       im the avatar    just hear us out ,53,3
5900,11645,Zuko,  my name is zuko  crown prince of the fire nation    o or at least i used to be    i know my people have distorted the ways of firebending  to be fueled by anger and rage  but now i want to learn the true way    the original way  when we came here  i never imagined   the sun warriors civilization was secretly alive  i am truly humbled to be in your presence    please  teach us ,53,3
5901,11647,Aang,  ran and shaw  there are two of them ,53,1
5902,11651,Zuko,  i dont believe it ,53,1
5903,11653,Aang,  umm  mister sun chief sir   yeah  im not a firebender yet    couldnt my friend here carry my fire for me ,53,3
5904,11656,Aang,im sorry  im just a little nervous    its like a little heartbeat ,53,1
5905,11659,Zuko,hurry up ,53,1
5906,11660,Aang,i cant    if i walk too fast  my flame will go out   ,53,1
5907,11661,Zuko,your flames   gonna go out   because its too small  youre too timid  give it more juice ,53,1
5908,11662,Aang,  but what if i cant control it ,53,1
5909,11663,Zuko,  you can do it  i know you can    youre a talented kid ,53,1
5910,11667,Aang,but once they find out im the avatar    ,53,3
5911,11670,Aang,  we could turn back now  weve already learned more about fire than wed hoped   ,53,3
5912,11671,Zuko,no  were seeing this through to the end  were gonna meet these masters and find out   whats so great about them ,53,0
5913,11672,Aang,  what if they judge us  and attack us ,53,3
5914,11673,Zuko,  well  were the fire prince and the avatar    i think we could take these guys in a fight  whoever they are   ,53,3
5915,11675,Zuko,bring em out ,53,1
5916,11682,Aang,whats happening     zuko  my fire went out ,53,1
5917,11683,Zuko,  what do you want me to do  ,53,1
5918,11684,Aang,give me some of yours   ,53,1
5919,11685,Zuko,  no  just make your own ,53,1
5920,11686,Aang,  i cant   ,53,1
5921,11687,Zuko,  get some from those warriors    hurry    stop cheating off me ,53,1
5922,11689,Aang,  quit being stingy ,53,1
5923,11691,Aang,uh oh ,53,1
5924,11693,Zuko,  these are the masters ,53,3
5925,11694,Aang,  still think we can take em ,53,3
5926,11695,Zuko,sshh  i never said that ,53,1
5927,11701,Aang,  zuko  i think were supposed to do the dragon dance with them ,53,3
5928,11702,Zuko,  what   what about this situation makes you think they want us to dance  ,53,1
5929,11703,Aang,well  i think they want us to do something  lets just try it ,53,1
5930,11704,Zuko,  fine ,53,1
5931,11708,Aang,wow ,53,1
5932,11709,Zuko,  i understand ,53,1
5933,11711,Zuko,  their fire was beautiful  i saw so many colors  colors ive never imagined ,53,3
5934,11712,Aang,  like firebending harmony ,53,3
5935,11714,Zuko,  i cant believe there are still living dragons  my uncle iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it ,53,3
5936,11715,Aang,  so your uncle lied ,53,1
5937,11717,Zuko,  he must have lied to protect them  so no one else would hunt them ,53,3
5938,11718,Aang,  all this time  i thought firebending was destruction  since i hurt katara  ive been too afraid and hesitant  but now i know what it really is     its energy  and life   ,53,1
5939,11719,Zuko,yeah  its like the sun    but inside of you  do you guys realize this ,53,1
5940,11721,Zuko,thats why my firebending was so weak before  because for so many years  hunting you   was my drive     it was my purpose    so when i joined you  i lost sight of my inner fire  but now  i have a new drive    i have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world ,53,1
5941,11725,Aang,  with this technique the dragons showed us  zuko and i will be unstoppable ,53,3
5942,11727,Sokka,yeah  thats a great dance you two learned there ,53,0
5943,11728,Zuko,its not a dance  its a firebending form ,53,3
5944,11729,Sokka,  well just tap dance our way to victory over the fire lord ,53,3
5945,11730,Zuko,  its a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old ,53,3
5946,11731,Katara,oh  yeah   whats your little form called  ,53,1
5947,11732,Zuko,  the dancing dragon ,53,1
5948,11735,Zuko,  no one can make tea like uncle    but hopefully i learned a thing or two  would you like to hear uncles favorite tea joke ,54,1
5949,11736,Katara,sure   ,54,3
5950,11737,Aang,i like jokes ,54,1
5951,11738,Toph,bring it ,54,3
5952,11739,Zuko,okay    well  i cant remember how it starts  but the punch line   is  leaf me alone  im bushed     well  its funnier when uncle tells it ,54,1
5953,11740,Katara,right     maybe thats because he remembers the whole thing ,54,2
5954,11742,Toph,its nice to get a chance to relax a little  it hardly ever happens ,54,1
5955,11744,Sokka,hey  can i talk to you for a second   ,54,1
5956,11746,Zuko,so  whats up   ,54,1
5957,11747,Sokka,if someone was captured by the fire nation  where would they be taken ,54,3
5958,11748,Zuko,what do you mean  who was captured ,54,3
5959,11749,Sokka,when the invasion plan failed  some of our troops were taken  i just want to know where they might be ,54,2
5960,11750,Zuko,i cant tell you ,54,1
5961,11751,Sokka,what  why not ,54,1
5962,11752,Zuko,trust me  knowing would just make you feel worse   ,54,1
5963,11753,Sokka,its my dad  he was captured too  i need to know what i put him through ,54,3
5964,11754,Zuko,its not good  sokka ,54,0
5965,11755,Sokka,please ,54,1
5966,11756,Zuko,my guess is  they were taken to the boiling rock ,54,3
5967,11757,Sokka,whats that ,54,1
5968,11758,Zuko,the highest security prison in the fire nation    its on an island in the middle of a boiling lake  its inescapable ,54,3
5969,11759,Sokka,so  where is this place ,54,1
5970,11760,Zuko,why do you need to know  what are you planning ,54,1
5971,11761,Sokka,nothing    boy  youre so paranoid ,54,1
5972,11762,Zuko,its in the middle of a volcano between here and the fire nation  you guys actually flew right past it on your way here ,54,3
5973,11763,Sokka,thanks  zuko    just knowing makes me feel better ,54,3
5974,11764,Zuko,  yeah  im sure it does ,54,1

5979,11771,Sokka,  look  i have to do this  the invasion plan was my idea  it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong    its my mistake  and its my job to fix it  i have to regain my honor  you cant stop me  zuko   ,54,1
5980,11772,Zuko,you need to regain your honor  believe me  i get it  im going with you ,54,3

5994,11789,Sokka,i know  i know  youve changed ,54,1
5995,11790,Zuko,  i meant my uncle  he was more of a father to me  and i really let him down ,54,3
5996,11791,Sokka,i think your uncle would be proud of you  leaving your home to come help us  thats hard ,54,1
5997,11792,Zuko,it wasnt that hard ,54,1
5998,11793,Sokka,really  you didnt leave behind anyone you cared about ,54,1
5999,11794,Zuko,well  i did have a girlfriend  mai ,54,1

6001,11796,Zuko,  yeah  everyone in the fire nation thinks im a traitor  i couldnt drag her into it ,54,1
6002,11797,Sokka,my first girlfriend turned into the moon ,54,1
6003,11798,Zuko,  thats rough  buddy ,54,1
6004,11800,Zuko,there it is    theres plenty of steam to keep us covered  as long as were quiet  we should be able to navigate through it without being caught ,54,3
6005,11802,Zuko,  were going down  the balloons not working anymore   ,54,1
6006,11803,Sokka,the air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we cant fly ,54,3
6007,11804,Zuko,  so what are we supposed to do ,54,1
6008,11805,Sokka,i dont know  crash landing ,54,1
6009,11807,Zuko,  how are we gonna get off the island if the balloon wont work ,54,1
6010,11808,Sokka,well figure something out  i suspected it might be a one way ticket ,54,2
6011,11809,Zuko,you knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway ,54,1
6012,11810,Sokka,  my dad might be here  i had to come and see ,54,2
6013,11811,Zuko,uncle always said i never thought things through  but this     this is just crazy ,54,1
6014,11812,Sokka,  hey  i never wanted you to come along in the first place  and for the record  i always think things through  but my plans havent exactly worked  so this time  im playing it by ear  so there   ,54,0

6026,11847,Zuko,can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison ,54,1
6027,11850,Zuko,no  thats not it  the boiling rock  it holds the fire nations most dangerous criminals  right    so what about war prisoners ,54,3
6028,11852,Sokka,it sure looks cold in there ,54,1
6029,11859,Zuko,hey there  fellow guard  how goes it ,54,3
6030,11860,Sokka,  zuko ,54,1

6033,11863,Zuko,yeah  im sure ,54,1
6034,11864,Sokka,no  no   ,54,1
6035,11865,Zuko,im really sorry  sokka ,54,1
6036,11866,Sokka,so we came all this way for nothing  i failed     again ,54,1
6037,11867,Zuko,ah    what would uncle say    sometimes  clouds have two sides    a dark and light  and a silver lining in between  its like a silver sandwich    so     when life seems hard       take a bite out of the silver sandwich ,54,3
6038,11869,Sokka,maybe we havent failed after all ,54,2
6039,11870,Zuko,thats the spirit    i cant believe that worked    i didnt even know what i was saying ,54,3
6040,11871,Sokka,no  what you said made no sense at all  but look       its suki ,54,1

6053,11910,Sokka,so  listen  i think i have an escape plan  i checked out the coolers again  and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained  right ,54,3
6054,11911,Zuko,yeah    ,54,1
6055,11912,Sokka,so  theyre completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in  well  to keep the cold in  it also has to keep the heat out  right ,54,3
6056,11914,Sokka,its a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water ,54,0
6057,11915,Zuko,  the cooler as a boat  are you sure ,54,3
6058,11916,Sokka,im telling you  itll work    i walked around the perimeter  theres a blind spot between two guard towers  its the perfect launching point    i already tested it out  well roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current  itll take us straight across  as long as we dont make a sound  no one will notice    and bing bang boom  were home free ,54,0
6059,11919,Sokka,  what  we didnt     w we didnt say that ,54,1
6060,11920,Zuko,yeah  you heard wrong ,54,1
6061,11922,Zuko,theres nothing to get in on ,54,1
6062,11923,Sokka,yeah  the only thing were hatching is     an egg ,54,1
6063,11927,Sokka,okay  youre in    now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler  from the inside ,54,3

6072,11948,Zuko,well  what should we do  are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night ,54,3
6073,11949,Sokka,i dont know  is it right for me to risk sukis freedom  all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up ,54,2
6074,11950,Zuko,its your call  sokka ,54,1
6075,11953,Sokka,fine  everybody in the cooler  lets go   ,54,1

6077,11956,Sokka,  if i had just cut my losses at the invasion  maybe we wouldnt be in this mess  maybe sometimes its just better to call it quits before you fail ,54,2
6078,11957,Zuko,no  its not  look sokka  youre going to fail a lot before things work out ,54,1
6079,11958,Sokka,  that supposed to make me feel better ,54,1
6080,11959,Zuko,  even though youll probably fail over and over and over again    ,54,2
6081,11960,Sokka,seriously  not helping ,54,1
6082,11961,Zuko,  you have to try every time  you cant quit because youre afraid you might fail ,54,2

6123,12089,Sokka,my dad and i came up with the plan together  were gonna commandeer the gondola   and were gonna take a hostage with us so they wont cut the lines ,55,3
6124,12091,Sokka,my dad already thought of that  he said well need a distraction  thats why were gonna start a prison riot ,55,1

6134,12131,Sokka,hey  im confused too  but the wardens in a bad mood  and     irrational  so if you ask me  its best not to question it  and just do what he says   ,55,1

6136,12140,Sokka,this isnt working ,55,1

6204,12289,Katara,  oh  everyone trusts you now  i was the first person to trust you    remember  back in ba sing se    and you turned around and betrayed me  betrayed all of us ,56,1
6205,12290,Zuko,  what can i do to make it up to you ,56,1
6206,12291,Katara,  you really want to know  hmm  maybe you could reconquer ba sing se in the name of the earth king    or  i know  you could bring my mother back ,56,2
6207,12294,Zuko,sorry  do you need to talk to sokka  too ,56,1
6208,12297,Sokka,  well  hello       uh  zuko  yes  why would i be expecting anyone different    so whats on your mind ,56,1
6209,12298,Zuko,your sister  she hates me  and i dont know why  but i do care what she thinks of me ,56,1
6210,12299,Sokka,nah  she doesnt hate you  katara doesnt hate anyone  except maybe some people in the fire nation    no  i mean  uh  not people who are good  but used to be bad  i mean  bad people  fire nation people who are still bad  whove never been good and probably wont be  ever ,56,1
6211,12300,Zuko,  stop  okay  listen  i know this may seem out of nowhere  but i want you to tell me what happened to your mother ,56,1
6212,12301,Sokka,  what  why would you want to know that ,56,1
6213,12302,Zuko,katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in ba sing se  and again just now when she was yelling at me  i think somehow shes connected her anger at that to her anger at me ,56,3
6214,12303,Sokka,  its not a day i like to remember ,56,1
6215,12305,Young Katara,im going to find mom   ,56,1
6216,12306,Sokka,  many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant  a fire nation raid    we were badly outnumbered  but somehow  we managed to drive them off  as quickly as they came  they just left ,56,3
6217,12308,Sokka,i was so relieved when it was over  but thats because i didnt know yet what had happened  i didnt know we had lost our mother ,56,1
6218,12309,Zuko,wait  can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village  like what the lead ship looked like ,56,3
6219,12310,Sokka,yeah     sea ravens    the main ship had flags with sea ravens on them ,56,3
6220,12311,Zuko,the symbol of the southern raiders  thanks  sokka ,56,3

6225,12317,Zuko,i know who killed your mother    and im going to help you find him ,56,1
6226,12319,Katara,i need to borrow appa ,56,1
6227,12320,Aang,  why  is it your turn to take a little field trip with zuko ,56,1
6228,12321,Katara,yes  it is ,56,1

6233,12327,Katara,  ugh  i knew you wouldnt understand   ,56,1
6234,12328,Aang,wait  stop  i do understand  youre feeling unbelievable pain and rage  how do think i felt about the sandbenders when they stole appa  how do you think i felt about the fire nation when i found out what happened to my people ,56,1
6235,12329,Zuko,she needs this  aang  this is about getting closure and justice ,56,3
6236,12330,Aang,i dont think so  i think its about getting revenge ,56,1
6237,12331,Katara,  fine  maybe it is  maybe thats what i need  maybe thats what he deserves ,56,2
6238,12332,Aang,katara  you sound like jet ,56,1
6239,12333,Katara,its not the same  jet attacked the innocent  this man  hes a monster ,56,3
6240,12334,Sokka,katara  she was my mother  too  but i think aang might be right ,56,2
6241,12335,Katara,then you didnt love her the way i did ,56,1
6242,12336,Sokka,  katara ,56,1
6243,12337,Aang,the monks used to say that revenge is like a two headed rat viper  while you watch your enemy go down  youre being poisoned yourself ,56,3
6244,12338,Zuko,thats cute  but this isnt air temple preschool  its the real world ,56,1
6245,12339,Katara,now that i know hes out there     now that i know we can find him  i feel like i have no choice ,56,1
6246,12340,Aang,katara  you do have a choice  forgiveness ,56,3
6247,12341,Zuko,thats the same as doing nothing ,56,3
6248,12342,Aang,no  its not  its easy to do nothing  but its hard to forgive ,56,1
6249,12343,Katara,its not just hard  its impossible   ,56,1
6250,12345,Aang,so you were just gonna take appa anyway ,56,1
6251,12346,Katara,yes ,56,1
6252,12347,Aang,its okay  because i forgive you    that give you any ideas ,56,1
6253,12348,Katara,dont try to stop us ,56,1
6254,12349,Aang,i wasnt planning to  this is a journey you need to take  you need to face this man    but when you do  please dont choose revenge  let your anger out  and then let it go  forgive him ,56,3
6255,12350,Zuko,  okay  well be sure to do that  guru goody goody   ,56,0
6256,12351,Katara,thanks for understanding  aang  yip yip   ,56,3

6261,12356,Sokka,so  can i borrow momo for a week ,56,1
6262,12357,Aang,  why do you need momo ,56,1
6263,12359,Zuko,we need to find the fire navy communication tower  all the navys movements are coordinated by messenger hawk  and every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed ,56,3
6264,12360,Katara,  so once we find the communication tower  we bust in and take the information we need ,56,3
6265,12361,Zuko,  not exactly  we need to be stealthy and make sure no one spots us    otherwise theyll warn the southern raiders long before we reach them ,56,3

6276,12383,Zuko,your mother was a brave woman ,56,1
6277,12384,Katara,  i know ,56,1
6278,12386,Zuko,there    see those sea raven flags    its the southern raiders ,56,3
6279,12387,Katara,  lets do this ,56,3

6281,12394,Zuko,you dont remember her  you will soon  trust me ,56,3
6282,12398,Zuko,think back  think back to your last raid on the southern water tribe ,56,3
6283,12400,Zuko,  dont lie  you look her in the eye and you tell me you dont remember what you did ,56,1
6284,12402,Katara,its not him    hes not the man ,56,3
6285,12403,Zuko,what  what do you mean hes not  hes the leader of the southern raiders  he has to be the guy ,56,3
6286,12405,Zuko,if youre not the man were looking for  who is ,56,3
6287,12418,Katara,that was him  that was the monster ,56,1
6288,12422,Zuko,we werent behind the bush    and i wouldnt try firebending again ,56,3
6289,12425,Katara,do you know who i am ,56,1
6290,12427,Katara,oh  you better remember me like your life depends on it  why dont you take a closer look   ,56,1
6291,12432,Young Katara,  mommy  im scared ,56,1
6292,12441,Katara,she lied to you    she was protecting the last waterbender ,56,1
6293,12443,Katara,  me ,56,1
6294,12446,Katara,  i always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing  but now that i see you  i think i understand  theres just nothing inside you  nothing at all  youre pathetic and sad and empty ,56,1
6295,12448,Katara,but as much as i hate you     i just cant do it ,56,1
6296,12450,Aang,katara  are you okay ,56,1
6297,12451,Katara,im doing fine ,56,1
6298,12452,Aang,zuko told me what you did  or what you didnt do  i guess  im proud of you ,56,1
6299,12453,Katara,i wanted to do it  i wanted to take out all my anger at him  but i couldnt  i dont know if its because im too weak to do it or because im strong enough not to ,56,1
6300,12454,Aang,you did the right thing  forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing ,56,3
6301,12455,Katara,  but i didnt forgive him  ill never forgive him    but i am ready to forgive you ,56,1
6302,12457,Zuko,you were right about what katara needed  violence wasnt the answer ,56,3
6303,12458,Aang,it never is ,56,1
6304,12459,Zuko,then i have a question for you    what are you gonna do when you face my father ,56,1
6305,12462,Katara,doesnt it seem kind of weird that were hiding from the fire lord in his own house ,57,3
6306,12463,Zuko,i told you    my father hasnt come here since our family was actually happy  and that was a long time ago  its the last place anyone would think to look for us ,57,1
6307,12465,Sokka,you guys are not gonna believe this  theres a play about us ,57,3
6308,12467,Katara,what  how is that possible ,57,2
6309,12468,Sokka,listen to this        the boy in the iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright pu on tim    who scoured the globe gathering information on the avatar  from the icy south pole to the heart of ba sing se    his sources include singing nomads  pirates  prisoners of war  and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage  ,57,3
6310,12470,Zuko,  ugh  my mother used to take us to see them  they butchered love amongst the dragons every year ,57,1
6311,12471,Katara,sokka  do you really think its a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves ,57,0
6312,12472,Sokka,  come on  a day at the theater  this is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense ive been missing   ,57,1
6313,12474,Aang,  hey  uh     i wanted to sit there ,57,1
6314,12475,Zuko,  just sit next to me  whats the big deal ,57,1
6315,12476,Aang,i was just  i wanted to     okay   ,57,1
6316,12478,Toph,why are we sitting in the nosebleed section  my feet cant see a thing from up here ,57,1
6317,12479,Katara,dont worry  ill tell your feet whats happening ,57,1
6318,12486,Sokka,  this is pathetic  my jokes are way funnier than this   ,57,1
6319,12487,Toph,  i think hes got you pegged ,57,1
6320,12490,Katara,  well  thats just silly  i dont sound like that ,57,1
6321,12491,Toph,  oh man  this writers a genius ,57,1
6322,12500,Aang,wait  is that a woman playing me ,57,3
6323,12508,Aang,  i dont do that  thats not what im like  and im not a woman   ,57,1
6324,12509,Toph,  oh  they nailed you  twinkle toes   ,57,1
6325,12517,Zuko,  they make me look totally stiff and humorless ,57,3
6326,12518,Katara,  actually  i think that actors pretty spot on ,57,1
6327,12519,Zuko,  how could you say that ,57,1
6328,12525,Aang,ugh ,57,1
6329,12551,Sokka,  shhh    im trying to watch   ,57,1
6330,12555,Aang,ugh ,57,1
6331,12557,Zuko,  so far  this intermission is the best part of the play ,57,0
6332,12558,Sokka,  apparently  the playwright thinks im an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time ,57,1
6333,12560,Sokka,  i know ,57,1
6334,12561,Aang,  at least the sokka actor kind of looks like you    that woman playing the avatar doesnt resemble me at all ,57,3
6335,12562,Toph,i dont know  you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys ,57,1
6336,12563,Aang,  argh ,57,1
6337,12564,Katara,relax  aang  theyre not accurate portrayals  its not like im a preachy crybaby who cant resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time    what ,57,3
6338,12565,Aang,  yeah  thats not you at all ,57,1
6339,12566,Toph,listen friends  its obvious that the playwright did his research  i know it must hurt  but what youre seeing up there on that stage is the truth ,57,1
6340,12570,Toph,this is it  this must be where i come in ,57,3
6341,12573,Toph,  here it comes    ,57,1
6342,12578,Toph,wait a minute      i sound like a guy  a really buff guy ,57,1
6343,12579,Katara,well toph  what you hear up there is the truth  it hurts  doesnt it ,57,1
6344,12580,Toph,are you kidding me  i wouldnt have cast it any other way    at least its not a flying bald lady   ,57,3
6345,12599,Zuko,did jet just     die ,57,1
6346,12600,Sokka,you know  it was really unclear ,57,3
6347,12607,Sokka,  oh  youre getting up    can you get me some fire flakes    ooh  and fire gummies   ,57,1
6348,12615,Katara,  you didnt really say that  did you ,57,1
6349,12616,Zuko,i might as well have ,57,2
6350,12625,Sokka,youre one to talk  suki  didnt azula take you captive  thats right  she did ,57,3
6351,12627,Sokka,im just saying    ,57,1
6352,12628,Katara,does anyone know where aang is ,57,3
6353,12629,Sokka,he left to get me fire gummies  like  ten minutes ago  and im still waiting ,57,1
6354,12630,Katara,im gonna check outside ,57,1
6355,12632,Katara,are you all right ,57,1
6356,12633,Aang,  no  im not  i hate this play   ,57,1
6357,12634,Katara,i know its upsetting  but it sounds like youre overreacting ,57,1
6358,12635,Aang,overreacting  if i hadnt blocked my chakra  id probably be in the avatar state right now ,57,2
6359,12637,Sokka,suki  what are the chances you can get me backstage  i got some jokes i want to give to the actor me ,57,1
6360,12639,Toph,  geez  everyones getting so upset about their characters  even you seem more down than usual  and thats saying something ,57,1
6361,12640,Zuko,you dont get it  its different for you  you get a muscly version of yourself  taking down ten bad guys at once  and making sassy remarks ,57,1
6362,12641,Toph,yeah  thats pretty great ,57,1
6363,12642,Zuko,but for me  it takes all the mistakes ive made in my life  and shoves them back in my face  my uncle  hes always been on my side  even when things were bad  he was there for me  he taught me so much  and how do i repay him  with a knife in his back  its my greatest regret  and i may never get to redeem myself ,57,1
6364,12643,Toph,  you have redeemed yourself to your uncle  you dont realize it  but you already have ,57,3
6365,12644,Zuko,how do you know ,57,1
6366,12645,Toph,because i once had a long conversation with the guy  and all he would talk about was you ,57,1
6367,12646,Zuko,really ,57,1
6368,12647,Toph,yeah  and it was kind of annoying ,57,1
6369,12648,Zuko,oh  sorry ,57,1
6370,12649,Toph,but it was also very sweet  all your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path  and see the light  now youre here with us  hed be proud   ,57,3
6371,12650,Zuko,ow  what was that for ,57,1
6372,12651,Toph,thats how i show affection ,57,1
6373,12654,Zuko,the scars not on the wrong side   ,57,1
6374,12659,Sokka,actually  i think i can help you  im a big sokka fan  but i dont think youre representing him quite as well as you could be ,57,3
6375,12661,Sokka,  just hear me out    heres something i think the real sokka would say    what does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages  a cabbage patch ,57,3
6376,12664,Sokka,  also  dont be afraid to make up some phrases  especially before an attack  something like      flying kick a pow     ,57,3
6377,12666,Sokka,im just a guy who likes comedy ,57,1
6378,12668,Aang,katara  did you really mean what you said in there ,57,1
6379,12669,Katara,in where  what are you talking about ,57,1
6380,12670,Aang,on stage  when you said i was just like a     brother to you  and you didnt have feelings for me ,57,1
6381,12671,Katara,i didnt say that  an actor said that ,57,1
6382,12672,Aang,but its true  isnt it  we kissed at the invasion  and i thought we were gonna be together  but were not ,57,3
6383,12673,Katara,aang  i dont know ,57,1
6384,12674,Aang,why dont you know ,57,1
6385,12675,Katara,because  were in the middle of a war  and  we have other things to worry about  this isnt the right time ,57,3
6386,12676,Aang,well  when is the right time ,57,3
6387,12677,Katara,aang  im sorry  but right now im just a little confused ,57,1
6388,12679,Katara,i just said i was confused  im going inside   ,57,1
6389,12680,Aang,ugh  im such an idiot   ,57,1
6390,12682,Sokka,heres what you missed     we went to the fire nation  and you got better  and katara was the painted lady  and i got a sword  and i think combustion man died  oh  look  the invasions about to start  shhh ,57,3
6391,12688,Sokka,  i told him to say that ,57,1
6392,12695,Sokka,  i guess thats it  the plays caught up to the present now ,57,3
6393,12697,Sokka,  but it is over  unless       this is the future ,57,3
6394,12720,Zuko,that     wasnt a good play ,57,0
6395,12721,Aang,ill say ,57,1
6396,12722,Katara,no kidding ,57,1
6397,12724,Toph,you said it ,57,1
6398,12725,Sokka,  but the effects were decent ,57,1
6399,12728,Zuko,more ferocious  imagine striking through your opponents heart ,58,3
6400,12729,Aang,  im trying ,58,1
6401,12730,Zuko,now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo    that sounded pathetic  i said roar ,58,1
6402,12732,Katara,  who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice ,58,1
6403,12733,Aang,  ooh  ooh  me  me  me   ,58,1
6404,12734,Zuko,  hey    your lessons not over yet  get back here   ,58,1
6405,12736,Zuko,  fine    if you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day  then go ahead   ,58,1
6406,12737,Sokka,maybe zukos right  sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy  but i know   just the thing to change all that    beach party ,58,2
6407,12739,Aang,check out my appa sand sculpture   ,58,1
6408,12740,Toph,not bad  baldy    but ive been working on my sandbending    youre gonna love this ,58,1
6409,12742,Aang,  whoa  wow  youve even made a little earth king and bosco ,58,1
6410,12744,Toph,try and top that  sokka ,58,3
6411,12745,Sokka,  ta da ,58,1
6412,12746,Aang,is that a blubbering blob monster ,58,3
6413,12747,Sokka,  no  its suki ,58,1
6414,12749,Toph,suki  well all understand if you break up with him over this ,58,3
6415,12752,Aang,but it doesnt even look like  aah ,58,1
6416,12754,Aang,  what are you doing ,58,1
6417,12755,Zuko,teaching you a lesson ,58,1
6418,12757,Katara,what happened ,58,1
6419,12758,Sokka,  zukos gone crazy  i made a sand sculpture of suki and he destroyed it    oh  and hes attacking aang ,58,3
6420,12760,Aang,get a grip before i blast you off this roof ,58,3
6421,12761,Zuko,go ahead and do it ,58,1
6422,12763,Aang,enough ,58,1
6423,12765,Katara,  whats wrong with you  you could have hurt aang ,58,1
6424,12766,Zuko,whats wrong with me  whats wrong with all of you  how can you sit around having beach parties when sozins comet is only three days away    why are you all looking at me like im crazy ,58,1
6425,12767,Aang,about sozins comet     i was actually gonna wait to fight the fire lord until after it came ,58,3
6426,12768,Zuko,  after ,58,1
6427,12769,Aang,im not ready  i need more time to master firebending ,58,3
6428,12770,Toph,and frankly  your earthbending could still use some work too   ,58,3
6429,12771,Zuko,so  you all knew aang was going to wait ,58,3
6430,12772,Sokka,honestly  if aang tries to fight the fire lord now  hes going to lose    no offense ,58,3
6431,12773,Katara,the whole point of fighting the fire lord before the comet was to stop the fire nation from winning the war  but they pretty much won the war when they took ba sing se  things cant get any worse ,58,3
6432,12774,Zuko,youre wrong    its about to get worse than you can even imagine    the day before the eclipse  my father asked me to attend an important war meeting  it was what i dreamed about for so many years  my father had finally accepted me back ,58,1
6433,12780,Zuko,the people of the earth kingdom are proud and strong  they can endure anything  as long as they have hope ,58,3
6434,12782,Zuko,well  thats not exactly what i ,58,1
6435,12783,Azula,i think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground ,58,3
6436,12787,Zuko,  i wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan  but im ashamed to say i didnt    my whole life  i struggled to gain my fathers love and acceptance  but once i had it  i realized id lost myself getting there  id forgotten who i was ,58,1
6437,12788,Katara,  i cant believe this ,58,1
6438,12789,Sokka,i always knew the fire lord was a bad guy  but his plan is just pure evil ,58,1
6439,12790,Aang,what am i gonna do ,58,1
6440,12791,Zuko,  i know youre scared  and i know youre not ready to save the world  but if you dont defeat the fire lord before the comet comes  there wont be a world to save anymore ,58,3
6441,12792,Aang,why didnt you tell me about your dads crazy plan sooner   ,58,1
6442,12793,Zuko,i didnt think i had to  i assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet  no one told me you decided to wait ,58,3
6443,12794,Aang,  this is bad    this is really  really bad ,58,1
6444,12795,Katara,aang  you dont have to do this alone ,58,3
6445,12797,Toph,yeah  if we all fight the fire lord together  we got a shot at taking him down ,58,3
6446,12798,Sokka,all right  team avatar is back  air    water    earth    fire    fan and sword   ,58,3
6447,12799,Aang,fighting the fire lord is going to be the hardest thing weve ever done together  but i wouldnt want to do it any other way ,58,3
6448,12801,Toph,yeah ,58,1
6449,12802,Sokka,all right ,58,1
6450,12803,Katara,get over here  zuko  being part of the group also means being part of group hugs ,58,3
6451,12805,Zuko,theres one technique you need to know before facing my father   how to redirect lightning    if you let the energy in your own body flow  the lightning will follow it    you turn your opponents energy against them ,58,3
6452,12806,Aang,thats like waterbending   ,58,1
6453,12807,Zuko,exactly  my uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders ,58,3
6454,12808,Aang,so  have you ever redirected lightning before ,58,3
6455,12809,Zuko,once  against my father ,58,3
6456,12810,Aang,what did it feel like ,58,1
6457,12811,Zuko,  exhilarating       but terrifying  you feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body  but you know if you make the wrong move  its over ,58,1
6458,12812,Aang,  well  not over over  i mean theres always katara and a little spirit water action    am i right ,58,3
6459,12813,Katara,actually  i used it all up after azula shot you ,58,1
6460,12814,Aang,  oh ,58,1
6461,12815,Zuko,youll have to take the fire lords life before he takes yours ,58,3
6462,12816,Aang,yeah  ill just do that ,58,1
6463,12818,Sokka,gather round  team avatar    in order to take out the fire lord   or in this case  the melon lord   our timing has to be perfect    first  suki and i will draw his fire  then  katara and zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense    and while the melon lord is distracted    aang swoops in     and bam    he delivers the final blow ,58,0
6464,12819,Toph,uh     what about me ,58,1
6465,12820,Sokka,for now  youre the melon lords forces ,58,3
6466,12821,Toph,  so i get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you ,58,1
6467,12822,Sokka,whatever makes the training feel more realistic ,58,3
6468,12823,Toph,sweetness ,58,1
6469,12825,Toph,mwah ha ha ha ,58,1
6470,12827,Sokka,watch it  toph ,58,1
6471,12828,Toph,i am not toph  i am melon lord  mwah ha ha ha ha ha ,58,1
6472,12830,Sokka,now  aang ,58,3
6473,12832,Zuko,what are you waiting for  take him out ,58,1
6474,12833,Aang,  i cant ,58,1
6475,12834,Sokka,  whats wrong with you  if this was the real deal  youd be shot full of lightning right now ,58,1
6476,12835,Aang,im sorry  but it just didnt feel right  i didnt feel like myself ,58,1
6477,12837,Sokka,  there  thats how its done ,58,1
6478,12839,Katara,  i have a surprise for everyone ,58,1
6479,12840,Toph,i knew it  you did have a secret thing with haru   ,58,1
6480,12841,Katara,uh  no    i was looking for cooking pots in the attic  and i found this    look at baby zuko  isnt he cute ,58,1
6481,12843,Katara,  oh  lighten up  im just teasing ,58,1
6482,12844,Zuko,thats not me  its my father ,58,1
6483,12847,Zuko,well  that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster  and the worst father in the history of fathers ,58,1
6484,12848,Aang,  but hes still a human being ,58,3
6485,12849,Zuko,youre going to defend him ,58,3
6486,12850,Aang,no  i agree with you    fire lord ozai is a horrible person  and the world would probably be better off without him  but theres got to be another way ,58,2
6487,12851,Zuko,like what ,58,1
6488,12852,Aang,i dont know    maybe we can make some big pots of glue  and then i can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he cant bend anymore ,58,2
6489,12853,Zuko,  yeah  then you can show him his baby pictures  and all those happy memories will make him good again   ,58,0
6490,12854,Aang,  do you really think that would work ,58,1
6491,12855,Zuko,  no ,58,1
6492,12856,Aang,  this goes against everything i learned from the monks  i cant just go around wiping out people i dont like ,58,1
6493,12857,Sokka,sure you can  youre the avatar  if its in the name of keeping balance  im pretty sure the universe will forgive you ,58,3
6494,12858,Aang,  this isnt a joke  sokka  none of you understand the position im in ,58,3
6495,12859,Katara,aang  we do understand  its just    ,58,3
6496,12860,Aang,just what  katara  what ,58,1
6497,12861,Katara,were trying to help ,58,1
6498,12862,Aang,then  when you figure out a way for me to beat the fire lord without taking his life  id love to hear it   ,58,3
6499,12863,Katara,aang  dont walk away from this   ,58,1
6500,12864,Zuko,  let him go  he needs time to sort it out by himself ,58,3
6501,12866,Aang,  hey  momo  i dont suppose you know what i should do    i didnt think so ,58,1

6508,12877,Sokka,look  theres his footprints    the trail ends here ,58,3
6509,12879,Katara,maybe he was captured ,58,2
6510,12880,Sokka,i dont think so    theres no sign of a struggle ,58,1
6511,12881,Toph,i bet he ran away again ,58,1
6512,12882,Sokka,uh uh  he left behind his glider and appa ,58,1
6513,12883,Toph,then what do you think happened to him  oh sleuthy one ,58,1
6514,12884,Sokka,its pretty obvious  aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle  hes definitely on a spirit world journey ,58,3
6515,12885,Zuko,but if he was  wouldnt his body still be here ,58,3
6516,12886,Sokka,  oh  yeah  forgot about that ,58,1
6517,12887,Katara,then hes got to be somewhere on ember island  lets split up and look for him ,58,2
6518,12889,Toph,im going with zuko    what   everyone else went on a life changing field trip with zuko  now its my turn ,58,1
6519,12894,Toph,and then when i was nine  i ran away again ,58,1
6520,12895,Zuko,uh huh ,58,1
6521,12896,Toph,i know i shouldnt complain  my parents gave me everything i ever asked for  but they never gave me the one thing i really wanted  their love  you know what i mean ,58,1
6522,12897,Zuko,  look  i know you had a really rough childhood  but we should really focus on finding aang   ,58,1
6523,12898,Toph,this is the worst field trip ever   ,58,1
6524,12900,Sokka,judging by the looks on your faces  im guessing you guys didnt find aang  either   ,58,1
6525,12901,Zuko,no  its like he just     disappeared ,58,1
6526,12902,Toph,hey  wait a minute  has anyone noticed that momo is missing  too ,58,1
6527,12903,Sokka,  oh no  i knew it was only a matter of time    appa ate momo    momo  im coming for you  buddy ,58,1
6528,12904,Katara,sokka  appa didnt eat momo  hes probably with aang ,58,2
6529,12905,Sokka,thats just what appa wants you to think   ,58,1
6530,12906,Zuko,get out of the bisons mouth  sokka  we have a real problem here  aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away ,58,1

6587,13029,Aang,  you didnt really kill chin    technically  he fell to his own doom because he was too stubborn to get out of the way ,59,3
6588,13031,Aang,  i knew i shouldnt have asked kyoshi ,59,1
6589,13033,Sokka,so  bumi       how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in omashu ,59,1
6590,13043,Zuko,  nah ,59,1
6591,13044,Sokka,  no  not really ,59,1
6592,13046,Aang,i need to look deep inside myself ,59,1
6593,13051,Zuko,  where     where is he ,59,3
6594,13054,Katara,are you okay ,59,1
6595,13055,Zuko,  no  im not okay  my uncle hates me  i know it    he loved and supported me in every way he could  and i still turned against him  how can i even face him ,59,1
6596,13056,Katara,  zuko  youre sorry for what you did  right ,59,1
6597,13057,Zuko,more sorry than ive been about anything in my entire life ,59,1
6598,13058,Katara,then hell forgive you  he will ,59,3
6599,13060,Zuko,uncle ,59,1
6600,13062,Aang,  all these past avatars    they keep telling me im gonna have to do it  they dont get it    youre right  maybe an air nomad avatar will understand where im coming from    i know you cant really talk  pretending you can just helps me think    im going to pretend i didnt pretend to hear that ,59,2
6601,13065,Aang,avatar yangchen    the monks always taught me that all life is sacred  even the life of the tiniest spider fly caught in its own web ,59,3
6602,13067,Aang,  i know  im even a vegetarian  ive always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever  and ive only had to use violence for necessary defense  and ive certainly never used it to take a life ,59,1
6603,13069,Aang,but the monks taught me that i had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free ,59,3
6604,13071,Aang,  i guess i dont have a choice  momo    i have to kill the fire lord ,59,3
6605,13073,Zuko,  uncle    i know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me    but i want you to know    i am so  so  sorry  uncle  i am so sorry and ashamed of what i did  i dont know how i can ever make it up to you  but ill    how can you forgive me so easily  i thought you would be furious with me ,59,1
6606,13074,Iroh,  i was never angry with you  i was sad because i was afraid you lost your way ,59,1
6607,13075,Zuko,  i did lose my way ,59,1
6608,13076,Iroh,  but you found it again    and you did it by yourself    and i am so happy you found your way here   ,59,1
6609,13077,Zuko,it wasnt that hard  uncle  you have a pretty strong scent ,59,1
6610,13079,Aang,wait    is it just me  or are those mountains getting bigger ,59,1
6611,13081,Aang,theyre not getting larger    theyre getting closer    the whole island is moving ,59,1
6612,13083,Aang,its amazing momo  the biggest animal in the world  ive gotta to swim around and find its face   ,59,0
6613,13085,Zuko,  uncle  youre the only person other than the avatar who can   possibly defeat the father lord ,59,3
6614,13086,Toph,you mean the fire lord ,59,3
6615,13087,Zuko,  thats what i just said ,59,1
6616,13088,Iroh,hmmm    ,59,1
6617,13089,Zuko,we need you to come with us ,59,1
6618,13090,Iroh,  no  zuko  it wont turn out well ,59,1
6619,13091,Zuko,  you can beat him    and well be there to help ,59,3
6620,13092,Iroh,even if i did defeat ozai    and i dont know that i could  it would be the wrong way to end the war    history would see it as just more senseless violence  a brother killing a brother to grab power  the only way for this war to end peacefully is for the avatar to defeat the fire lord ,59,1
6621,13093,Zuko,  and then     then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne ,59,3
6622,13094,Iroh,  no  someone new must take the throne  an idealist with a pure heart   and unquestionable honor  it has to be you  prince zuko ,59,3
6623,13095,Zuko,  unquestionable honor  but ive made so many mistakes ,59,3
6624,13096,Iroh,yes  you have    youve struggled  youve suffered  but you have always followed your own path    you restored your own honor  and only you can restore the honor of the fire nation ,59,3
6625,13097,Zuko,  ill try  uncle ,59,1
6626,13098,Toph,  well  what if aang doesnt come back ,59,1
6627,13099,Iroh,  sozins comet is arriving  and our destinies are upon us  aang will face the fire lord    when i was a boy  i had a vision that i would one day take ba sing se    only now do i see that my destiny is to take it back from the fire nation    so the earth kingdom can be free again ,59,3
6628,13101,Iroh,yes    zuko  you must return to the fire nation  so that when the fire lord falls  you can assume the throne and restore peace and order    but azula will be there  waiting for you ,59,3
6629,13102,Zuko,i can handle azula ,59,3
6630,13103,Iroh,not alone    youll need help ,59,1
6631,13104,Zuko,  youre right  katara    how would you like to help me put azula in her place ,59,3
6632,13105,Katara,it would be my pleasure ,59,3
6633,13106,Sokka,what about us    whats our destiny today ,59,0
6634,13107,Iroh,  what do you think it is ,59,1
6635,13108,Sokka,  i think that  even though we dont know where aang is  we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet ,59,3
6636,13109,Toph,  and that means when aang does face the fire lord  well be right there if he needs us   ,59,3
6637,13112,Sokka,  thank you  master ,59,0
6638,13114,Zuko,  so if im going to be fire lord after the war is over    what are you going to do ,59,3
6639,13115,Iroh,  after i re conquer ba sing se  im going to re conquer my tea shop  and im going to play pai sho every day   ,59,1
6640,13117,Katara,goodbye  general iroh ,59,1
6641,13118,Iroh,  goodbye  everyone  today  destiny is our friend    i know it ,59,0
6642,13120,Aang,  a lion turtle    maybe you can help me  everyone  even my own past lives  are expecting me to end someones life    but i dont know if i can do it ,59,2
6643,13128,Katara,zuko  dont worry  we can take azula ,60,1
6644,13129,Zuko,its not her im worried about  im worried about aang  what if he doesnt have the guts to take out my father  what if he loses ,60,1
6645,13130,Katara,  aang wont lose  hes gonna come back    he has to   ,60,1

6654,13149,Sokka,were too late  the fleets already taking off ,60,3

6658,13156,Azula,five  to be precise  in which time an assassin couldve snuck in  done away with me and been on his merry way ,60,3
6659,13158,Azula,is this how you plan to treat your new fire lord  with tardiness and disloyalty ,60,3
