1402,Katara,i tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but  it didnt work  if there was just a way to help them help themselves ,6,positive

1804,Zuko,  youre too late  zhao  the avatars inside and the doors are sealed ,8,positive
1807,Aang,  is it about that vision  the one of the comet ,8,positive
1809,Aang,what does it mean ,8,positive
1811,Aang,  so the comet made them stronger ,8,positive
1813,Aang,  but that happened a hundred years ago  what does the comet have to do with the war now ,8,positive
1815,Aang,  but i havent even started learning waterbending  not to mention earth and fire ,8,positive
1819,Katara,  hows aang gonna make it out of this ,8,positive
1820,Sokka,  how are we gonna make it out of this ,8,positive

1847,Aang,  its what avatar roku said  im supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives ,9,positive
1848,Sokka,  well  lets see  you pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years  im sure you can master three more elements by next summer ,9,positive
1849,Aang,  i havent even started waterbending and were still weeks away from the north pole  what am i gonna do ,9,positive
1850,Katara,  calm down  its going to be okay    if you want  i can try to teach you some of the stuff i know ,9,positive
1851,Aang,  youd do that ,9,positive
1852,Katara,  well need to find a good source of water first ,9,positive
1853,Sokka,  maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in ,9,positive

1859,Aang,  oh right  time to practice waterbending   ,9,positive

1861,Aang,you could     clean the gunk out of appas toes   ,9,positive
1862,Sokka,  so  while you guys are playing in the water  im supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bisons feet ,9,positive
1863,Aang,  mud and bugs ,9,positive
1864,Sokka,okay   ,9,positive
1866,Zuko,  someones changing our course ,9,positive
1868,Zuko,  what is the meaning of this mutiny  no one told you to change course   ,9,positive
1869,Iroh,actually  someone did  i assure you  it is a matter of utmost importance  prince zuko   ,9,positive
1870,Zuko,  is it something to do with the avatar ,9,positive
1871,Iroh,even more urgent  it seems  i     i have lost my lotus tile   ,9,positive
1872,Zuko,  lotus tile ,9,positive
1873,Iroh,for my pai sho game  most people think the lotus tile insignificant  but it is essential for the unusual strategy that i employ ,9,positive
1874,Zuko,  youve changed our course for a stupid lotus tile ,9,positive
1875,Iroh,see  you  like most people  underestimate its value  just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call    hopefully  they will have the lotus tile in stock and i can get on with my life    im lucky to have such an understanding nephew ,9,positive
1877,Sokka,yeah  dont get too happy  youve got to do me next   ,9,positive
1879,Katara,this is a pretty basic move  but it still took me months to perfect  so dont get frustrated if you dont get it right away    just push and pull the water like this  the key is getting the wrist movement right ,9,positive
1880,Aang,  like this   ,9,positive
1881,Katara,  thats almost right  if you keep practicing im sure eventually ,9,positive
1882,Aang,hey  im bending it already   ,9,positive
1883,Katara,  wow  i cant believe you got that so quickly  it took me two months to learn that move ,9,positive
1884,Aang,  well  you had to figure it all on your own  im lucky enough to have a great teacher ,9,positive
1885,Katara,  thanks ,9,positive
1886,Aang,so  whats next ,9,positive
1887,Katara,this is a more difficult move  i call it streaming the water    its harder than it looks  so dont be disappointed if    nice work    though the over the head flare was unnecessary ,9,positive
1888,Aang,sorry    well  dont stop now  keep em coming ,9,positive
1889,Katara,  well i kind of know this one other move  but its pretty hard  i havent even totally figured it out yet  the idea is to create a big  powerful wave   ,9,positive
1890,Aang,so  like this   ,9,positive
1891,Sokka,  aang    ,9,positive
1892,Aang,  looks like i got the hang of that move  what else do you got ,9,positive
1893,Katara,  thats enough practicing for today ,9,positive
1894,Sokka,  yeah  ill say    you just  practiced  our supplies down the river   ,9,positive
1895,Aang,  uh  sorry    im sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff ,9,positive
1896,Sokka,my life was hard enough when you were just an airbender   ,9,positive
1898,Sokka,  weve got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that king bumi gave us  lets spend it wisely ,9,positive
1899,Aang,uh  make that two copper pieces  sokka  i couldnt say no to this whistle   ,9,positive
1900,Sokka,  it doesnt even work    see  even momo thinks its a piece of junk ,9,positive

1904,Aang,  sure  what are curios ,9,positive
1907,Aang,  huh ,9,positive

1913,Aang,  where did you get a waterbending scroll ,9,positive
1915,Sokka,  wait a minute     sea loving traders  with suspiciously acquired merchandise    and pet reptile birds    you guys are pirates ,9,positive
1918,Katara,so  how much for the  uh  traded scroll ,9,positive
1920,Aang,  i know how to deal with these guys  katara  pirates love to haggle    watch and learn    lets say to the price of  one copper piece   ,9,positive
1922,Aang,  okay  two copper pieces ,9,positive
1924,Katara,  aang  can we get out of here  i feel like were getting weird looks ,9,positive

1927,Aang,what was that all about  katara ,9,positive
1928,Sokka,yeah  i was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection ,9,positive
1929,Katara,  ill just feel a lot better once we get away from here ,9,positive
1932,Aang,  well  well  look whos come to their senses  told you the haggling would pay off ,9,positive
1934,Katara,  i dont think these pirates are here to trade with us   ,9,positive
1936,Sokka,  whoa   ,9,positive
1942,Aang,no thanks    grab on tight ,9,positive
1943,Katara,aang  i thought we were running away from the pirates   ,9,positive
1944,Aang,just hang on   ,9,positive
1946,Aang,  i used to kind of look up to pirates  but those guys are terrible ,9,positive
1947,Katara,  i know  thats why i took this   ,9,positive
1948,Aang,  no way ,9,positive
1949,Katara,  isnt it great ,9,positive
1950,Sokka,no wonder they were trying to hack us up  you stole their waterbending scroll ,9,positive
1951,Katara,  i prefer to think of it as high risk trading ,9,positive
1952,Aang,  good one  katara ,9,positive
1953,Katara,sokka  where do you think they got it  they stole it from a waterbender ,9,positive
1954,Sokka,it doesnt matter  you put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid  fancy splashes ,9,positive
1955,Katara,these are real waterbending forms  you know how crucial it is for aang to learn waterbending ,9,positive
1956,Sokka,  whatever ,9,positive
1957,Aang,well  whats done is done  we have it  we might as well learn from it ,9,positive
1959,Iroh,ive checked all the shops on this pier  not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace ,9,positive
1960,Zuko,its good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone ,9,positive
1961,Iroh,quite the contrary  i always say  the only thing better than finding something you are looking for   is finding something you werent looking for at a great bargain   ,9,positive
1962,Zuko,you bought a tsungi horn ,9,positive
1963,Iroh,for music night on the ship  now  if we only had some woodwinds    oh  this place looks promising    oh  that is handsome  wouldnt it look magnificent in the galley ,9,positive

1970,Sokka,im sorry  but you deserved that    youve been duped  shes only interested in teaching herself ,9,positive
1971,Katara,  aang will get his turn once i figure out the water whip    ugh  why cant i get this stupid move ,9,positive
1972,Aang,youll get it    you just gotta shift your weight through the stances    there  see  the key to bending is ,9,positive
1973,Katara,  will you please shut your air hole  believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes  why dont we just throw the scroll away since youre so naturally gifted    what    oh my gosh  aang  i am so sorry  i dont know what came over me  but you know what  it wont happen again    here  this is yours  i dont want to have anything to do with it anymore ,9,positive

2523,Aang,no  i mean i really knew them  i might not look it  but im a hundred and twelve years old  i was there one hundred years ago on the day youre talking about    there seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened  first of all  jin wei and wei jin werent enemies  they were brothers  twins in fact  and they were eight  and most importantly  they were just playing a game  the sacred orb from the legend  that was the ball  and the eastern and western gates were the goal posts  jin wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it  wei jin didnt steal the ball  he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal  but he stepped out of bounds  so the official put him in the penalty box  not for twenty long years but for two short minutes    there was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison  it was just a game ,11,positive
2525,Aang,nope  just a regular ball ,11,positive
2527,Aang,thats what the game was called  redemption  as soon as you got the ball from one end to the other  everyone would yell  redemption     dont get me wrong  wei jin was kind of a slob and jin wei was a little stuffy  that much is true  but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field ,11,positive
2531,Aang,good to see you  boy  did you miss me   ,11,positive
2533,Aang,  well  you know i try ,11,positive
2538,Sokka,thats some luck you knew jin wei and wei jin ,11,positive

2640,Katara,  what do you mean ,12,positive
2641,Aang,  i dont want to talk about it ,12,positive
2642,Katara,it has to do with your dream  doesnt it    talk to me ,12,positive
2643,Aang,well  its kind of a long story ,12,positive
2645,Katara,im going to try to get a little fire going ,12,positive
2647,Aang,ill never forget the day the monks told me i was the avatar  i was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall  i was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter ,12,positive
2649,Aang,first you got to form the ball  then you got to get on quick ,12,positive
2653,Aang,you kind of have to balance on it like its a top ,12,positive
2656,Aang,i made it up ,12,positive
2661,Aang,how do you know its me ,12,positive
2664,Aang,those were some of my favorite toys when i was little   ,12,positive

2674,Iroh,do you really want to know ,12,positive
2677,Iroh,its okay  may i join you ,12,positive
2680,Iroh,  try to understand  my nephew is a complicated young man  he has been through much ,12,positive
2682,Young Zuko,let me in ,12,positive
2683,Iroh,  prince zuko  whats wrong ,12,positive
2684,Young Zuko,i want to go into the war chamber   but the guard wont let me pass ,12,positive
2685,Iroh,  youre not missing anything  trust me  these meetings are dreadfully boring ,12,positive
2686,Young Zuko,if im going to rule this nation one day  dont you think i need to start learning as much as i can ,12,positive
2687,Iroh,very well  but you must promise not to speak    these old folks are a bit sensitive  you know ,12,positive
2688,Young Zuko,  thank you  uncle ,12,positive
2693,Young Zuko,  you cant sacrifice an entire division like that  those soldiers love and defend our nation  how can you betray them ,12,positive
2695,Iroh,zuko was right  you see    but it was not his place to speak out  and there were dire consequences   ,12,positive
2697,Katara,so you were upset that you were the avatar  why wouldnt you be excited about it ,12,positive
2698,Aang,well  i didnt know how to feel about it  all i knew was that after i found out  everything began changing ,12,positive
2700,Aang,hey  not bad  you guys have been practicing ,12,positive
2702,Aang,great    whats going on ,12,positive
2704,Aang,but im still the same  nothings changed  so  what  i cant play ,12,positive
2706,Aang,oh  okay ,12,positive
2712,Aang,what do you mean ,12,positive
2714,Aang,hey ,12,positive
2722,Iroh,after zukos outburst in the meeting  the fire lord became very angry with him    he said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect  and there was only one way to resolve this ,12,positive
2724,Iroh,thats right  zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid  but zuko misunderstood    when he turned to face his opponent  he was surprised to see it was not the general    zuko had spoken out against the generals plan  but by doing so in the fire lords war room  it was the fire lord whom he had disrespected    zuko would have to duel his own father ,12,positive
2726,Aang,then  just when i was feeling better  something worse happened ,12,positive
2734,Katara,thats awful  aang  i dont know what to say ,12,positive
2735,Aang,  how could they do that to me  they wanted to take away everything i knew and everyone i loved   ,12,positive
2736,Katara,whoa  hot cinders ,12,positive
2738,Aang,im sorry i got so mad ,12,positive
2739,Katara,you have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that ,12,positive
2740,Aang,well  thats not exactly what happened    i was afraid and confused  i didnt know what to do ,12,positive
2743,Aang,  i never saw gyatso again    next thing i knew  i was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg ,12,positive
2745,Katara,you ran away ,12,positive
2746,Aang,and then the fire nation attacked our temple  my people needed me and i wasnt there to help ,12,positive
2747,Katara,you dont know what would have  ,12,positive
2748,Aang,the world needed me and i wasnt there to help ,12,positive
2749,Katara,aang    ,12,positive
2750,Aang,the fisherman was right  i did turn my back on the world ,12,positive
2751,Katara,youre being too hard on yourself  even if you did run away  i think it was meant to be  if you had stayed  you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders ,12,positive
2752,Aang,you dont know that ,12,positive
2753,Katara,i know it was meant to be this way  the world needs you now  you give people hope ,12,positive
2755,Iroh,when prince zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him  he begged for mercy ,12,positive
2757,Young Zuko,  please  father  i only had the fire nations best interest at heart  im sorry i spoke out of turn   ,12,positive
2760,Young Zuko,  i meant you no disrespect    i am your loyal son ,12,positive
2763,Young Zuko,i wont fight you ,12,positive
2766,Iroh,  i looked away ,12,positive
2769,Iroh,it was no accident  after the duel  the fire lord said that by refusing to fight  zuko had shown shameful weakness  as punishment  he was banished and sent to capture the avatar  only then could he return with his honor ,12,positive
2771,Iroh,things will never return to normal  but the important thing is the avatar gives zuko hope ,12,positive
2774,Katara,  its okay  youre safe ,12,positive
2776,Katara,what do you mean  wheres sokka ,12,positive

3160,Sokka,oh yeah  shes crazy about you  all you have to do now is not mess it up ,14,positive
3161,Aang,well  how do i do that ,14,positive
3162,Sokka,the number once mistake nice guys like you make  being too nice ,14,positive
3163,Aang,you can be too nice ,14,positive
3164,Sokka,yep  if you want to keep her interested  you have to act aloof  like you dont really care one way or the other ,14,positive
3165,Aang,well  okay    ,14,positive
3168,Aang,see you later      ,14,positive
3170,Sokka,  wow  that kid is good ,14,positive
3173,Katara,okay  okay  but one more thing ,14,positive

3196,Aang,excuse me    where can a guy find one of those things ,14,positive

3199,Aang,not just any flower  a panda lily  ive seen it in action and boy  does it work ,14,positive
3201,Sokka,flowers are fine once youre married  but at this early stage  its critical that you maintain maximum aloofness ,14,positive
3202,Aang,but my heart is telling me to get this flower    and aunt wu said if i trusted in my heart  i will be with the one i love ,14,positive
3203,Sokka,  what  dont tell me you believe in that stuff  too ,14,positive
3204,Aang,  well  aunt wu hasnt been wrong yet  why should she be wrong about love    there  on the rim ,14,positive
3206,Aang,  oh no    aunt wu was wrong ,14,positive
3208,Sokka,those people all think theyre safe  weve got to warn them ,14,positive
3209,Aang,theres no time to walk    grab on   ,14,positive
3211,Aang,  hi  katara ,14,positive
3212,Katara,  can you believe she wont let me in  and after all the business ive given her ,14,positive
3213,Aang,but she doesnt even charge ,14,positive

3891,Aang,  im sorry  this is the last part of the temple thats the same as it was  i want it to stay that way ,17,positive
3893,Aang,thanks   ,17,positive
3895,Sokka,these lanterns are terrible  i cant see    why would you want to use fireflies for light   ,17,positive
3899,Sokka,  okay     so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room ,17,positive
3901,Sokka,so  this place is an explosion waiting to happen ,17,positive

3913,Katara,no    aaaaah    i cant believe im flying ,17,positive
3915,Aang,just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you dont swallow a bug   ,17,positive
3916,Katara,teo was right about the air  all i had to do was trust it  let it carry me ,17,positive
3917,Aang,even though teos not an airbender  he really does have the spirit of one    ive been thinking  if you want to see whats in that room  id be happy to open the door for you ,17,positive
3919,Katara,wait    how do i land this thing  what if i land over   a ack ack bleck  bug  bug  ack  that was a bug ,17,positive
3922,Sokka,  ugh  week old egg smell ,17,positive

3969,Aang,good  well need it ,17,positive
3972,Sokka,thank you  youre a genius ,17,positive
3974,Sokka,see  the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air borne    but once it did  it just kept going    you could put a hole in the top  but then all the hot air would escape  so the question became  how do you keep a lid on hot air ,17,positive
3975,Katara,ugh  if only we knew   ,17,positive
3976,Sokka,a lid is actually the answer  if you control the hot air  you control the war balloon ,17,positive
3977,Katara,huh  thats actually pretty smart ,17,positive
3978,Sokka,okay  weve got four kinds of bombs    smoke  slime  fire  and    ,17,positive

4633,Azula,and if i were to have you thrown overboard  would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore ,21,positive
4635,Azula,  well then  maybe you should worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you  and worry more about me  whos still mulling it over   ,21,positive
4638,Sokka,  there it is ,21,positive

6323,Toph,i can feel it with my own two feet ,28,positive
6325,Katara,  lets get out of here ,28,positive
6326,Aang,  maybe we should face them  find out who they are  who knows  maybe theyre friendly ,28,positive
6327,Sokka,  always the optimist    ,28,positive

6342,Katara,  i cant believe those girls followed us all the way from omashu ,28,positive
6343,Toph,  i still think we could have taken them ,28,positive
6344,Katara,are you kidding me    the crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough  but last time we saw them  one of those girls did something that took my bending away  thats scary ,28,positive
6346,Sokka,  oh no  the sun is rising  weve been up all night with no sleep ,28,positive
6347,Aang,  sokka  well be okay ,28,positive
6348,Sokka,  are you sure  ive never not slept before    what if i fall asleep now and something happens    and something always happens ,28,positive
6349,Katara,every time we land  those girls are there  so well just have to keep flying ,28,positive
6351,Aang,we cant keep flying forever ,28,positive
6353,Aang,  so whats our plan ,28,positive

6366,Katara,  of course  we couldve gotten some sleep earlier    if toph didnt have such issues ,28,positive
6367,Toph,  what  ,28,positive
6368,Aang,  all right  all right  everyones exhausted  lets just get some rest ,28,positive
6369,Toph,  no  i want to hear what katara has to say  you think i have issues ,28,positive
6370,Katara,  im just saying  maybe if you helped out earlier  we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep   and then maybe we wouldnt be in this situation ,28,positive
6372,Toph,youre blaming me for this ,28,positive
6374,Aang,  no  no  shes not blaming you ,28,positive

6379,Aang,  how dare you blame appa  he saved your life three times today  if theres anyone to blame its you  youre always talking about how you carry your own weight  but youre not  he is  appas carrying your weight  he never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us ,28,positive
6380,Toph,  im out of here ,28,positive
6381,Sokka,  wait ,28,positive
6383,Aang,what did i just do    i cant believe i yelled at my earthbending teacher  now shes gone ,28,positive
6384,Katara,  i know  were all just trying to get used to each other  and i was so mean to her ,28,positive
6385,Sokka,  yeah  you two were pretty much jerks ,28,positive
6386,Katara,  thanks  sokka ,28,positive
6387,Sokka,no problem ,28,positive
6388,Katara,we need to find toph and apologize ,28,positive
6389,Sokka,okay  but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us ,28,positive
6390,Aang,  i have a plan ,28,positive
6392,Aang,toph was right  the fur was leaving a trail right to us  but now that hes clean  no more trail ,28,positive
6393,Katara,are you sure hes okay to fly ,28,positive
6394,Aang,hell be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here    im going to use appas fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off course ,28,positive
6396,Iroh,ow     that really hurt my tailbone ,28,positive
6405,Azula,the avatars trying to give us the slip    you two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison    ill follow this trail ,28,positive

6431,Aang,so what now ,28,positive
6432,Azula,  now  now  its over  youre tired and you have no place to go    you can run  but ill catch you ,28,positive
6433,Aang,  im not running ,28,positive
6435,Iroh,  here is your tea    you seem a little too young to be traveling alone ,28,positive
6436,Toph,  you seem a little too old ,28,positive
6437,Iroh,  perhaps i am ,28,positive
6438,Toph,  i know what youre thinking     i look like i cant handle being by myself ,28,positive
6439,Iroh,i wasnt thinking that ,28,positive
6440,Toph,you wouldnt even let me pour my own cup of tea ,28,positive
6441,Iroh,i poured your tea because i wanted to and for no other reason ,28,positive
6442,Toph,people see me and think im weak  they want to take care of me  but i can take care of myself  by myself ,28,positive
6443,Iroh,you sound like my nephew  always thinking you need to do things on your own  without anyones support  there is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you  not that i love you  i just met you ,28,positive
6444,Toph,  so where is your nephew ,28,positive
6445,Iroh,ive been tracking him actually ,28,positive
6446,Toph,is he lost ,28,positive
6447,Iroh,  yes  a little bit    his life has recently changed and hes going through very difficult times  hes trying to figure out who he is and he went away ,28,positive
6448,Toph,so now youre following him ,28,positive
6449,Iroh,i know he doesnt want me around him right now  but if he needs me  ill be there ,28,positive
6450,Toph,your nephew is very lucky  even if he doesnt know it    thank you ,28,positive
6451,Iroh,my pleasure  sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of lifes true delights ,28,positive
6452,Toph,  no  thank you for what you said  it helped me ,28,positive
6453,Iroh,im glad ,28,positive
6454,Toph,  oh  and about your nephew  maybe you should tell him that you need him  too ,28,positive
6456,Azula,do you really want to fight me ,28,positive
6458,Zuko,yes  i really do ,28,positive
6459,Aang,  zuko ,28,positive
6460,Azula,  i was wondering when youd show up  zuzu ,28,positive
6461,Aang,   zuzu  ,28,positive
6462,Zuko,  back off  azula  hes mine ,28,positive
6463,Azula,  im not going anywhere ,28,positive

6468,Iroh,get up ,28,positive
6470,Toph,i thought you guys could use a little help ,28,positive
6471,Katara,  thanks ,28,positive
6473,Azula,  well  look at this  enemies and traitors  all working together  im done    i know when im beaten  you got me  a princess surrenders with honor ,28,positive

6480,Zuko,  leave ,28,positive
6484,Aang,todays the day    can you believe it  after all that time searching for a teacher  im finally starting earthbending    and this place    its perfect  dont you think  sokka    oh  youre still sleeping  huh    sorry ,29,positive
6486,Toph,goooood morning    earthbending student ,29,positive
6488,Aang,good morning  sifu toph ,29,positive
6489,Katara,  hey  you never called me sifu katara ,29,positive
6490,Aang,  well  if you think i should    ,29,positive
6492,Toph,sorry  snoozles  well do our earthbending as   quietly as we can ,29,positive
6494,Aang,  so what move are you going to teach me first    rock a lanche    the trembler  oh  maybe i could learn to make a   whirlpool out of land ,29,positive
6495,Toph,  lets start with       move a rock ,29,positive
6496,Aang,  sounds good  sounds good ,29,positive
6498,Toph,the key to earthbending is your stance  youve got to be steady and strong  rock is a stubborn element  if youre going to move it  youve got to be like a rock yourself ,29,positive
6499,Aang,like a rock  got it ,29,positive
6500,Toph,good  now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple    okay  you ready to give it a try ,29,positive
6501,Aang,im ready   ,29,positive
6502,Sokka,  rock beats airbender ,29,positive
6506,Iroh,my beloved lu ten  i will see you again ,29,positive
6508,Zuko,uncle     you were unconscious  azula did this to you  it was a surprise attack ,29,positive
6509,Iroh,somehow  thats not so surprising   ,29,positive
6510,Zuko,  i hope i made it the way you like it   ,29,positive
6511,Iroh,  good  that was very     uhhh     bracing   ,29,positive
6512,Zuko,so uncle  ive been thinking  its only a matter of time before i run into azula again  im going to need to know more advanced firebending if i want to stand a chance against her  i know what youre going to say  shes my sister and i should be trying to get along with her ,29,positive
6513,Iroh,  no  shes crazy  and she needs to go down    its time to resume your training ,29,positive
6515,Katara,i dont understand what went wrong  he did it exactly the way you did ,29,positive
6516,Aang,maybe theres another way     what if i came at the boulder from another angle ,29,positive
6517,Toph,no  thats the problem  youve got to stop thinking like an airbender  theres no different angle  no clever solution  no trickety trick thats going to move that rock  youve got to face it head on  and when i say head on  i mean like this      ,29,positive
6518,Aang,whoa ,29,positive
6520,Katara,  ive been training aang for a while now  he really responds well to a positive teaching experience  lots of encouragement and praise  kind words  if hes doing something wrong  maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction ,29,positive
6521,Toph,thanks  katara  a gentle nudge  ill try that    keep your knees high  twinkle toes ,29,positive
6523,Toph,rock like ,29,positive
6525,Toph,rock like ,29,positive
6527,Sokka,youre awfully cute  but unfortunately youre made of meat  just a bit closer       gotcha    you are one lucky little meat creature ,29,positive
6529,Iroh,lightning is a pure form of firebending  without aggression  it is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is  some call lightning the cold blooded fire  it is precise and deadly  like azula  to perform the technique requires peace of mind ,29,positive
6530,Zuko,i see  thats why were drinking tea  to calm the mind ,29,positive
6531,Iroh,oh yeah  good point  i mean  yes    there is energy all around us  the energy is both yin and yang  positive energy and negative energy  only a select few firebenders can separate these energies  this creates an imbalance  the energy wants to restore balance  and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together  you provide release and guidance  creating lightning   ,29,positive
6532,Zuko,im ready to try it ,29,positive
6533,Iroh,remember  once you separate the energy  you do not command it  you are simply its humble guide  breathe first ,29,positive
6535,Toph,this time were going to try something a little different  instead of moving a rock  youre going to stop a rock  get in your horse stance  im going to roll that boulder down at you  if you have the attitude of an earthbender  youll stay in your stance and stop the rock  like this   ,29,positive
6536,Katara,sorry toph  but are you really sure this is the way to teach aang earthbending ,29,positive
6537,Toph,im glad you said something  actually there is a better way    this way  youll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it  thank you  katara ,29,positive
6538,Aang,  yeah  thanks  katara ,29,positive
6539,Katara,  heh ,29,positive
6541,Aang,i guess i just panicked  i dont know what to say ,29,positive
6542,Toph,theres nothing to say  you blew it  you had a perfect stance  and a perfect form  but when it came right down to it  you didnt have the guts ,29,positive
6543,Aang,  i know  im sorry ,29,positive
6544,Toph,yeah  you are sorry  if youre not tough enough to stop the rock  then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly boned wimp  now  do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender ,29,positive
6545,Aang,no  i dont think i do ,29,positive
6546,Katara,aang  its no big deal  youll take a break and try earthbending again when youre ready  besides  you still have a lot of waterbending to work on  okay ,29,positive
6547,Aang,yeah  that sounds good ,29,positive
6548,Toph,yeah  whatever  go splash around until you feel better ,29,positive
6551,Zuko,why cant i do it  instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face     like everything always does ,29,positive
6552,Iroh,i was afraid this might happen  you will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you ,29,positive
6553,Zuko,what turmoil ,29,positive
6554,Iroh,zuko  you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away ,29,positive
6555,Zuko,but i dont feel any shame at all  im as proud as ever ,29,positive
6556,Iroh,prince zuko  pride is not the opposite of shame  but its source  true humility is the only antidote to shame ,29,positive
6557,Zuko,well  my life has been nothing but humbling lately ,29,positive
6558,Iroh,i have another idea  i will teach you a firebending move that even azula doesnt know  because i made it up myself   ,29,positive
6560,Sokka,you probably think i deserve this  dont you  look  im sorry i hunted you  but thats just the natural order of things  big things eat smaller things  nothing personal  but this time it didnt work out that way  i admit it     youre cute  okay  you convinced me  if i get out of this alive  its a karmically correct  vegetarian existence for me  no meat  even though meat is so tasty    hey  looks like my karma is already paying off  thats okay  i got it    now  come back boomerang ,29,positive
6562,Katara,you know this block youre having is only temporary  right ,29,positive
6563,Aang,i dont want to talk about it ,29,positive
6564,Katara,you do realize thats the problem  dont you  if you face this issue instead of avoiding it ,29,positive
6565,Aang,  i know  i know  i know  i know  i get it  all right  i need to face it head on like a rock  but i just cant do it  i dont know why i cant  but i cant ,29,positive
6566,Katara,aang  if fire and water are opposites  then whats the opposite of air ,29,positive
6567,Aang,i guess its earth ,29,positive
6568,Katara,thats why its so difficult for you to get this  youre working with your natural opposite  but youll figure it out  i know you will  think fast    excellent  you have the reflexes of a waterbending master ,29,positive
6569,Aang,thanks  katara  sifu katara   ,29,positive
6571,Iroh,fire is the element of power    the people of the fire nation have desire and will  and the energy to drive and achieve what they want  earth is the element of substance    the people of the earth kingdom are diverse and strong  they are persistent and enduring  air is the element of freedom    the air nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom  also  they apparently had pretty good senses of humor    water is the element of change    the people of the water tribe are capable of adapting to many things  they have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything ,29,positive
6572,Zuko,why are you telling me these things ,29,positive
6573,Iroh,it is important to draw wisdom from many different places  if you take it from only one place  it becomes rigid and stale    understanding others  the other elements  and the other nations will help you become whole   ,29,positive
6574,Zuko,all this four elements talk is sounding like avatar stuff ,29,positive
6575,Iroh,it is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the avatar so powerful  but it can make you more powerful  too  you see the technique im about to teach you is one i learned by studying the waterbenders ,29,positive
6577,Toph,aang  i found these nuts in your bag  i figured you wouldnt mind  and besides  even if you did  youre too much of a pushover to do anything about it ,29,positive
6578,Aang,as a matter of fact  i dont mind  im happy to share anything i have ,29,positive
6579,Toph,you know  im really glad you feel that way  because i also have this great new nutcracker ,29,positive
6581,Aang,actually  i prefer if you didnt       thats an antique  handcrafted by the monks       its a delicate instrument ,29,positive
6582,Toph,its not the only delicate instrument around here   ,29,positive
6583,Aang,  ohm ,29,positive
6584,Katara,hey aang  have you seen ,29,positive
6585,Aang,  meditating here ,29,positive
6586,Katara,its important  its almost sundown and sokka isnt back yet  i think we should search for him ,29,positive
6587,Aang,well find him faster if we split up   ,29,positive
6589,Sokka,okay  karma person or thing  whoevers in charge of this stuff  if i can just get out of this situation alive  i will give up meat and sarcasm  okay    ow  thats all i got  its pretty much my whole identity  sokka  the meat and sarcasm guy  but im willing to be sokka  the veggies and straight talk fellow  deal    aang  thank goodness  have you got any meat ,29,positive
6590,Aang,sokka  are you okay   ,29,positive
6591,Sokka,aggh  stop  stop  youre going to pull my fingers off and i dont think the rest of me is coming ,29,positive
6592,Aang,hmmm     i bet i can airbend you out of here   ,29,positive
6593,Sokka,seriously aang  i know youre new at it  but i could use a little earthbending here  how about it ,29,positive
6594,Aang,i cant     i cant do it ,29,positive
6595,Sokka,well  if you cant earthbend me out of here  go get toph ,29,positive
6596,Aang,i cant do that either ,29,positive
6597,Sokka,you cant  why not ,29,positive
6598,Aang,it would just be really     uncomfortable ,29,positive
6599,Sokka,uncomfortable    well  i wouldnt want you to feel uncomfortable    ,29,positive
6600,Aang,thanks  sokka  this whole earthbending thing really has me confused  theres so much pressure  everyone expects me to get it right away  it puts me in a really awkward position ,29,positive
6601,Sokka,awkward position  i think i know the feeling ,29,positive
6602,Aang,if i try  i fail  if i dont try  im never going to get it  i feel like im caught between a rock and a hard place ,29,positive
6603,Sokka,hmmm     how about that  aang  this is my friend  foo foo cuddlypoops  foo foo cuddlypoops  aang ,29,positive
6604,Aang,awww  what a cute name for a baby saber tooth moose lion cub ,29,positive
6605,Sokka,really  he looks nothing like a saber tooth moose lion ,29,positive
6606,Aang,its hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in  what are you doing out here little guy  did you lose your mama ,29,positive
6609,Iroh,waterbenders deal with the flow of energy  a waterbender lets their defense become their offense  turning their opponents energy against them  i learned a way to do this with lightning ,29,positive
6610,Zuko,you can teach me to redirect lightning ,29,positive
6611,Iroh,if you let the energy in your own body flow  the lightning will follow it  you must create a pathway from your fingertips  up your arm to your shoulder  then down into your stomach  the stomach is the source of energy in your body  it is called the sea of chi  only in my case it is more like a vast ocean    from the stomach  you direct it up again  and out the other arm  the stomach detour is critical  you must not let the lightning pass through your heart  or the damage could be deadly  you may wish to try a physical motion  to get a feel for the pathways flow  like this    now  are you focusing your energy  can you feel your own chi flowing in  down  up  and out ,29,positive
6612,Zuko,i think so ,29,positive
6613,Iroh,come on  youve got to feel the flow    excellent  youve got it ,29,positive
6614,Zuko,great  im ready to try it with real lightning ,29,positive
6615,Iroh,what  are you crazy  lightning is very dangerous ,29,positive
6616,Zuko,i thought that was the point  you teaching me to protect myself from it ,29,positive

7419,Aang,youre the idea guy ,33,positive
7420,Sokka,  so im the only one who can ever come up with a plan  thats a lot of pressure ,33,positive
7421,Katara,and also the complaining guy ,33,positive
7422,Sokka,that part i dont mind ,33,positive
7425,Iroh,its pronounced mushi ,33,positive
7427,Iroh,  uh  no  no  but may i just say youre like a flower in bloom  your beauty is intoxicating ,33,positive
7429,Zuko,  im going to forget i saw that   ,33,positive
7440,Katara,his chi is blocked    who did this to you ,33,positive
7442,Katara,  ty lee  she doesnt look dangerous  but she knows the human body and its weak points  its like she takes you down from the inside ,33,positive
7443,Sokka,  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh ,33,positive
7444,Katara,yes ,33,positive
7445,Sokka,what you just said  thats how were going to take down the drill  the same way ty lee took down all those big earthbenders ,33,positive
7446,Toph,by hitting its pressure points ,33,positive
7447,Aang,  well take it down from the inside ,33,positive
7449,Toph,  once i whip up some cover  youre not going to be able to see  so  stay close to me ,33,positive

7464,Sokka,toph  come on ,33,positive
7465,Toph,no way am i going in that metal monster  i cant bend in there  ill try to slow it down out here ,33,positive
7466,Sokka,okay  good luck   ,33,positive
7468,Sokka,i need a plan of this machine  some schematics that show what the inside looks like  then we can find its weak points ,33,positive
7469,Aang,where are we going to get something like that    what are you doing  someones going to hear us ,33,positive
7470,Sokka,thats the point  i figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it  and when something breaks    ,33,positive
7471,Katara,they come to fix it ,33,positive
7473,Katara,  hi ,33,positive
7475,Sokka,thisll work  thanks ,33,positive
7477,Sokka,it looks like the drill is made up of two main structures  theres the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell  the inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces  if we cut through them  the entire thing will collapse ,33,positive
7481,Iroh,  ooh  jasmine please ,33,positive
7483,Iroh,blaugh  ugh  coldest tea in ba sing se is more like it  what a disgrace ,33,positive
7487,Zuko,thanks  but i dont think you want me in your gang ,33,positive
7489,Zuko,  i said no ,33,positive
7492,Iroh,hey ,33,positive
7493,Zuko,  what are you doing firebending your tea  for a wise  old man  that was a pretty stupid move ,33,positive
7494,Iroh,  i know youre not supposed to cry over spilled tea  but       its just so sad ,33,positive
7496,Sokka,wow  it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans  were going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that ,33,positive
7497,Katara,  whats this  we  stuff  aang and i are going to have to do all the work ,33,positive
7498,Sokka,  look  im the plan guy  you two   are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys    together  were team avatar ,33,positive
7500,Sokka,  cmon team  dont quit now    were    ,33,positive
7501,Katara,  grrr ,33,positive
7503,Sokka,i mean    youre almost there ,33,positive
7505,Katara,  at this rate  we wont do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall ,33,positive
7506,Aang,i dont know how many more of those i have in me ,33,positive
7508,Sokka,do you hear that  we took it down  we better get out of here fast ,33,positive
7512,Sokka,  cmon brace     budge   ,33,positive
7513,Katara,this is bad  really bad ,33,positive
7514,Sokka,were putting everything weve got into busting these braces  but its taking too long ,33,positive
7515,Aang,  maybe we dont need to cut all the way through  toph has been teaching me that you shouldnt give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike    sokka  take a fighting stance  youve got to be quick and accurate  hit a series of points and break your opponents stance    and when hes reeling back  you deliver the final blow    his own weight becomes his downfall  literally ,33,positive
7517,Katara,so we just need to weaken the braces  instead of cutting all the way through ,33,positive
7518,Aang,then ill go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow ,33,positive
7519,Sokka,  and boom  it all comes crashing down ,33,positive
7520,Aang,everyone inside that wall  the whole world is counting on us ,33,positive
7521,Sokka,the whole world minus the fire nation that is ,33,positive
7523,Toph,  cmon  twinkle toes  hurry up ,33,positive
7525,Aang,thats enough  we need to get to the next one ,33,positive
7530,Azula,  lets go  ladies ,33,positive
7532,Sokka,good work  team avatar  now aang just needs to       duck ,33,positive
7534,Aang,  whoa ,33,positive

7550,Katara,  why dont you try blocking my chi now  circus freak ,33,positive
7551,Sokka,katara  keep that up  the pressure will build up in the drill  then when aang delivers the final blow  itll be ready to pop ,33,positive
7553,Aang,  this looks like a good spot  momo    general sung  tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here ,33,positive
7556,Sokka,good technique  little sister  keep it up  dont forget to breathe ,33,positive

8415,Sokka,look  we escaped from the dai li  we got appa back  im telling you  we should go to the earth king now and tell him our plan  were on a roll ,38,positive
8416,Katara,one good hour after weeks of trouble isnt much of a roll ,38,positive
8417,Sokka,we can build on it  if we want to invade the fire nation when the eclipse happens  well need the earth kings support ,38,positive
8418,Toph,what makes you think well get it  i dont know if youve noticed  but things dont usually go that smoothly for our little gang ,38,positive
8419,Sokka,i know  but ive got a good feeling about this  this time will be different ,38,positive
8420,Katara,sokka  long feng is in control of the city  his conspiracy with the dai li is too powerful  i think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us ,38,positive
8421,Toph,im with sweetness  ive seen enough of ba sing se    and i cant even see ,38,positive
8423,Aang,but now that we have appa back  theres nothing stopping us from telling the earth king the truth  about the conspiracy and the war ,38,positive
8424,Sokka,see  aangs with me    its the whole reason we came here in the first place  we have to try ,38,positive
8425,Katara,  well  i guess if the earth king knew the truth  things could change   ,38,positive
8426,Toph,  i dont trust the new positive sokka    long feng brainwashed you  didnt he  ,38,positive
8428,Sokka,thats probably the dai li searching for us    so ,38,positive
8430,Katara,  lets fly ,38,positive
8432,Toph,can we please buy a new saddle  riding bareback is terrifying   ,38,positive
8434,Sokka,there it is  that whole thing is the palace  the earth kings chamber should be in the center ,38,positive
8435,Katara,we have to be careful  long fengs probably warned the king that were coming ,38,positive
8436,Sokka,why would you assume that  if you ask me  i think were just gonna sail right in and    aahh ,38,positive
8437,Toph,what was that ,38,positive
8438,Sokka,surface to air rocks    more incoming ,38,positive

8479,Aang,  well  sir  theres a war going on right now  for the past one hundred years in fact  the dai lis kept it secret from you  its a conspiracy to control the city  and to control you ,38,positive
8482,Aang,long feng didnt want us to tell you  so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us  and blackmail is the least of his crimes  he brainwashed our friend ,38,positive
8488,Sokka,wait    i can prove hes lying  long feng said hes never seen a sky bison  ask him to lift his robe ,38,positive
8491,Aang,right there  appa bit him ,38,positive

8504,Katara,so youve never been outside the upper ring before ,38,positive
8506,Sokka,underneath lake laogai  your kingliness  to the dai lis secret headquarters  youre about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place ,38,positive
8508,Toph,its gone ,38,positive
8509,Sokka,oh dont tell me      thats okay  still got my positive attitude ,38,positive
8510,Katara,the dai li mustve known we were coming and destroyed the evidence ,38,positive
8512,Sokka,hey  if anything  this proves the conspiracy exists even more   ,38,positive
8514,Katara,  the wall  theyll never be able to cover that up in time ,38,positive
8515,Aang,oh  yeah    if you come with us to the outer wall  we can prove to you that the secret war is real ,38,positive
8517,Sokka,  if you come with us  this time you can ride on appa   ,38,positive
8519,Toph,first time flying ,38,positive
8521,Toph,yeah    i hate it  too ,38,positive
8523,Aang,i wish it wasnt ,38,positive
8526,Zuko,im not tired ,38,positive
8536,Aang,  its still there ,38,positive
8538,Sokka,its a drill  a giant drill   made by the fire nation to break through your walls   ,38,positive
8542,Katara,  really  then perhaps you could explain why theres a   fire nation insignia on your  construction project  ,38,positive
8547,Sokka,  looks like long feng is long gone  ha  ah  yeah  ive been waiting to use that one   ,38,positive
8550,Sokka,thats why we came to ba sing se  your highness  because we think you can help us end the war ,38,positive
8551,Aang,  we dont have much time  theres a comet coming this summer  its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength  theyll be unstoppable ,38,positive
8552,Sokka,but there is hope  before the comet comes  we have a window of opportunity  a solar eclipse is coming  the sun will be completely blocked out by the moon  and the firebenders will be helpless ,38,positive
8554,Sokka,thats the day we need to invade the fire nation    the day of black sun ,38,positive
8556,Sokka,youre already vulnerable  the fire nation wont stop until ba sing se falls  you can either sit back and wait for that to happen  or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance ,38,positive
8564,Aang,secret files ,38,positive
8566,Katara,  its a letter from your mom  your moms here in the city  and she wants to see you   ,38,positive

8591,Katara,i hate to say it  but we have to split up ,38,positive

8594,Aang,well  if im going to the eastern air temple  appa and i can drop you off at chameleon bay to see your dad ,38,positive
8595,Sokka,someone has to stay here with the earth king and help him plan for the invasion    i guess thats me ,38,positive
8596,Katara,no  sokka  i know how badly you wanna help dad  you go to chameleon bay  ill stay here with the king ,38,positive

8682,Azula,im talking about conquering the whole earth kingdom    for one hundred years  the fire nation has hammered away at ba sing se from the outside    but now were on the inside  and we can take it by ourselves ,39,positive
8684,Azula,from the inside  were in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the earth king  the key is the dai li  whoever controls the dai li   controls ba sing se ,39,positive

8772,Aang,  lets do this ,39,positive
8774,Aang,  what  why would i let go of katara  i     i love her ,39,positive
8776,Aang,why would i choose cosmic energy over katara    how could it be a bad thing that i feel an attachment to her  three chakras ago that was a good thing ,39,positive
8779,Katara,thank goodness youre here  suki  something terrible is going on  the fire nation has infiltrated the city  i just saw prince zuko and his uncle    we have to tell the earth king right away ,39,positive

8794,Toph,  its not  its the real deal ,39,positive

8801,Sokka,you dont know how much this means to me  dad  ill make you proud and ill finally prove to you what a great warrior i am ,39,positive
8803,Sokka,really ,39,positive
8806,Sokka,this cant be good news ,39,positive
8808,Azula,what is this about  your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here  you will not treat a kyoshi warrior this way ,39,positive
8810,Azula,what do you want ,39,positive
8812,Azula,oh ,39,positive
8814,Azula,why should i help you ,39,positive
8816,Azula,  im listening    ,39,positive
8819,Iroh,  i     i cant believe it ,39,positive
8820,Zuko,what is it  uncle ,39,positive
8821,Iroh,  great news  weve been invited to serve tea to the earth king   ,39,positive
8824,Sokka,so  what kind of trouble is katara in ,40,positive
8825,Aang,i dont know  in my vision  i just knew she needed help ,40,positive
8826,Sokka,it would be nice if your avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time    what is that ,40,positive
8828,Sokka,need a ride ,40,positive
8830,Azula,  the earth king and the council of five do not trust the dai li  they imprisoned your leader  long feng  soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you  seizing power today is a matter of life and death    this coup must be swift and decisive  the earth king and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously  long feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government    if i sense any disloyalty  any hesitation  any weakness at all    i will snuff it out    that is all ,40,positive
8834,Azula,there are still a few loose ends  the avatar  and my brother and uncle ,40,positive
8836,Iroh,many times i imagined myself here  at the threshold of the palace    but i always thought i would be here as a conqueror  instead  we are the earth kings personal guests  here to serve him tea  destiny is a funny thing ,40,positive
8837,Zuko,it sure is  uncle ,40,positive
8839,Toph,so how did it go with the guru  did you master the avatar state ,40,positive
8840,Aang,uh    ,40,positive
8844,Sokka,aang  are you okay ,40,positive
8845,Aang,im great  it went great with the guru  i completely mastered the avatar state    yeah ,40,positive
8847,Zuko,whats taking so long ,40,positive
8848,Iroh,maybe the earth king overslept ,40,positive
8850,Zuko,somethings not right ,40,positive
8852,Azula,its tea time ,40,positive
8853,Zuko,  azula ,40,positive
8854,Azula,have you met the dai li  theyre earthbenders  but they have a killer instinct thats so firebender  i just love it ,40,positive
8856,Iroh,did i ever tell you how i got the nickname  the dragon of the west  ,40,positive
8857,Azula,im not interested in a lengthy anecdote  uncle   ,40,positive
8858,Iroh,its more of a demonstration  really ,40,positive
8860,Iroh,come on  youll be fine ,40,positive
8861,Zuko,no  im tired of running  its time i faced azula ,40,positive
8863,Azula,youre so dramatic  what  are you going to challenge me to an agni kai ,40,positive
8864,Zuko,yes  i challenge you ,40,positive
8865,Azula,no thanks ,40,positive
8868,Aang,but  in my vision  i felt so sure she was in trouble ,40,positive
8870,Sokka,see  aang  shes with suki  theyre probably back at our apartment right now talking about make up or something ,40,positive
8871,Aang,okay  maybe youre right ,40,positive
8876,Katara,zuko ,40,positive
8878,Aang,momo ,40,positive
8880,Toph,theres no one else here ,40,positive
8881,Aang,katara is in trouble  i knew it ,40,positive
8882,Sokka,oh  no ,40,positive
8883,Toph,wait  someones at the door    actually  i know who it is  its an old friend of mine    glad to see youre okay ,40,positive
8884,Iroh,i need your help ,40,positive
8886,Aang,you guys know each other ,40,positive
8887,Toph,i met him in the woods once and knocked him down    then he gave me some tea and some very good advice ,40,positive
8888,Iroh,may i come in    princess azula is here in ba sing se ,40,positive
8889,Aang,she must have katara ,40,positive
8890,Iroh,she has captured my nephew as well ,40,positive
8891,Aang,then well work together to fight azula  and save katara and zuko ,40,positive
8892,Sokka,  whoa there  you lost me at  zuko  ,40,positive
8893,Iroh,i know how you must feel about my nephew    but believe me when i tell you that there is good inside him ,40,positive
8894,Sokka,   good inside him  isnt enough  why dont you come back when its outside him too  okay ,40,positive
8895,Aang,kataras in trouble  all of ba sing se is in trouble  working together is our best chance ,40,positive
8897,Iroh,i brought someone along who might help us ,40,positive
8900,Sokka,my sister  where are they keeping katara ,40,positive
8907,Katara,why did they throw you in here    oh  wait  let me guess  its a trap  so that when aang shows up to help me  you can finally have him in your little fire nation clutches ,40,positive
8909,Katara,  youre a terrible person  you know that  always following us  hunting the avatar  trying to capture the worlds last hope for peace  but what do you care  youre the fire lords son  spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood ,40,positive
8910,Zuko,  you dont know what youre talking about ,40,positive
8911,Katara,  i dont  how dare you  you have no idea what this war has put me through    me personally    the fire nation took my mother away from me ,40,positive
8912,Zuko,  im sorry    thats something we have in common ,40,positive
8914,Toph,well  whatd you know  there is an ancient city down there  but its deep ,40,positive
8916,Sokka,we should split up  aang  you go with iroh to look for katara and the angry jerk    no offense ,40,positive
8917,Iroh,  none taken ,40,positive
8918,Sokka,and ill go with toph to warn the earth king of azulas coup ,40,positive
8920,Aang,so  toph thinks you give pretty good advice  and great tea ,40,positive
8921,Iroh,the key to both is proper aging  whats on your mind ,40,positive
8923,Aang,well  i met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the avatar state and control this great power  but to do it  i had to let go of someone i love    and i just couldnt ,40,positive
8924,Iroh,perfection and power are overrated  i think you were very wise to choose happiness and love ,40,positive
8925,Aang,  what happens if we cant save anyone and beat azula  without the avatar state  what if im not powerful enough ,40,positive
8926,Iroh,i dont know the answer  sometimes  life is like this dark tunnel  you cant always see the light at the end of the tunnel  but if you just keep moving    you will come to a better place ,40,positive
8928,Sokka,theres general how ,40,positive
8932,Sokka,the coup is happening right now  weve gotta warn the earth king ,40,positive
8934,Sokka,thank goodness were in time ,40,positive
8937,Sokka,  uh  im kinda involved with suki ,40,positive

8953,Azula,i can see your whole history in your eyes  you were born with nothing  so youve had to struggle  and connive  and claw your way to power  but true power  the divine right to rule  is something youre born with  the fact is  they dont know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne  and which one is going to be bowing down    but i know  and you know    well ,40,positive

9079,Sokka,after what happened at ba sing se  we had to get you to safety  we flew back to chameleon bay where we found my father and the other water tribe men    the earth king decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise  so he set off alone    well  not completely alone    soon  the bay was overrun by fire nation ships  rather than fight them all  we captured a single ship and made it our disguise  since then weve been traveling west  we crossed through the serpents pass a few days ago  weve seen a few fire nation ships  but none have bothered us ,41,positive
9080,Aang,so what now ,41,positive
9082,Katara,  its sokkas invasion plan ,41,positive

9118,Azula,who cares  the avatar is dead       unless you think he somehow miraculously survived ,41,positive
9120,Katara,  this is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole  it has special properties so ive been saving it for something important ,41,positive
9122,Zuko,no  theres no way he could have survived   ,41,positive
9123,Azula,well  then im sure you have nothing to worry about ,41,positive

9162,Katara,he left ,41,positive
9164,Katara,aang  he just took his glider and disappeared  he has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone  that its all his responsibility ,41,positive
9166,Katara,its not brave  its selfish and stupid  we could be helping him and i know the world needs him  but doesnt he know how much we need him  too  how can he just leave us behind ,41,positive
9168,Katara,how could you leave us  dad    i mean  i know we had gran gran  and she loved us  but we were just so lost without you ,41,positive
9171,Katara,  i understand why you left  i really do  and i know that you had to go  so why do i still feel this way  im so sad and angry and hurt ,41,positive

9182,Zuko,why did you tell father that i was the one who killed the avatar ,41,positive
9183,Azula,cant this wait until the morning ,41,positive
9184,Zuko,it  cant ,41,positive
9185,Azula,  fine  you seemed so worried about how father would treat you because you hadnt captured the avatar  i figured if i gave you the credit  youd have nothing to worry about ,41,positive
9186,Zuko,but why ,41,positive
9187,Azula,  call it a generous gesture  i wanted to thank you for your help and i was happy to share the glory ,41,positive
9188,Zuko,youre lying ,41,positive
9189,Azula,  if you say so    ,41,positive
9190,Zuko,you have another motive for doing this  i just havent figured out what it is ,41,positive
9191,Azula,please zuko  what ulterior motive could i have  what could i possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the avatar    unless  somehow  the avatar was actually alive  all that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness  but you said it yourself  that was impossible    sleep well  zuzu ,41,positive
9193,Aang,im not gonna make it  i failed    roku ,41,positive
9195,Aang,but everyone thinks im dead again  they think ive abandoned them  and im losing this war  im letting the whole world down ,41,positive

9216,Aang,  i think i see a cave below ,42,positive
9217,Sokka,  sh  keep quiet ,42,positive
9219,Sokka,great job with the cloud camo  but next time  lets disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut   ,42,positive

9224,Katara,  sokka  we dont need to become cave people  what we need is some new clothes ,42,positive
9225,Aang,yeah  blending in is better than hiding out    if we get fire nation disguises    we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave ,42,positive
9226,Toph,  plus  they have real food out there  does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers ,42,positive

9449,Katara,  these people are starving  but youd turn your back on them    how can you be so cold and heartless ,43,positive
9450,Sokka,  im not turning my back  im just being realistic  we cant go around helping every rinky dink town we wander into  well be helping them all by taking out the fire lord   ,43,positive
9451,Toph,  hey  loud mouths  maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about    taking out the fire lord  ,43,positive

9474,Sokka,  look  we only have a few weeks to get to the fire lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse  which  by the way  only lasts for eight minutes  and we just lost a whole day  so if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule  we have to wake up early ,43,positive
9475,Toph,well im not waking up early ,43,positive
9476,Sokka,or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks ,43,positive

9521,Katara,  why would you say that  look how much better off these people are ,43,positive
9522,Sokka,yeah  now  but without her they wouldnt be able to fend for themselves  if she really wanted to help  she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory   ,43,positive
9523,Aang,spirit magic doesnt work that way  sokka  its more like      ,43,positive

10075,Azula,its never too early for a sitting with the court painter  zuko  make sure he gets your good side ,46,positive
10076,Zuko,wait  i need to ask you something    what do you remember about our great grandfathers history ,46,positive
10077,Azula,  oh  zuko  its so strange how your mind works    fire lord sozin began the war  of course    he spent his early years secretly preparing for it  he was as patient as he was clever  he famously waited for the comet  later renamed sozins comet  and used its power to launch his full scale invasion of the world    in the end  he died a very old and successful man ,46,positive
10078,Zuko,but how did he die ,46,positive
10079,Azula,  didnt you pay any attention in school  zuko  he died peacefully  in his sleep    he was ancient ,46,positive
10081,Zuko,what does it mean ,46,positive
10083,Zuko,  the fire sages keep the secret history in the dragonbone catacombs ,46,positive
10085,Zuko,  the final testimony of fire lord sozin ,46,positive
10088,Aang,  wherere we going ,46,positive
10097,Aang,  you were friends with fire lord sozin  ,46,positive
10103,Aang,you dont have to tell me ,46,positive
10105,Aang,wait  whose party is it ,46,positive
10124,Katara,do they have bathrooms in the spirit world ,46,positive
10125,Sokka,  as a matter of fact  they do not ,46,positive
10127,Aang,  hey  were almost at the southern air temple ,46,positive
10133,Aang,no way ,46,positive
10137,Aang,hes air surfing  i cant believe i never thought of that ,46,positive
10139,Aang,  thats amazing  i cant believe you were friends with monk gyatso just like i was ,46,positive
10160,Aang,  roku  its that girl who didnt even know youre alive ,46,positive
10193,Aang,this is amazing  roku  youre battling a volcano  and youre winning ,46,positive
10212,Aang,whos     wait  thats me  isnt it   ,46,positive
10214,Aang,roku  roku ,46,positive
10218,Zuko,that cant be it  wheres the rest of it   ,46,positive
10220,Zuko,  you sent this  didnt you  i found the secret history  which by the way should be renamed history most people already know  the note said that i needed to know about my great grandfathers death  but he was still alive in the end ,46,positive
10221,Iroh,  no  he wasnt ,46,positive
10222,Zuko,  what are you talking about ,46,positive
10223,Iroh,you have more than one great grandfather  prince zuko  sozin was your fathers grandfather    your mothers grandfather was avatar roku ,46,positive
10224,Zuko,  why are you telling me this ,46,positive
10225,Iroh,because understanding the struggle between your two great grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself    evil and good are always at war inside you  zuko  it is your nature  your legacy  but  there is a bright side    what happened generations ago can be resolved now  by you  because of your legacy  you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the fire nation  born in you  along with all the strife  is the power to restore balance to the world ,46,positive
10227,Iroh,this is a royal artifact  its supposed to be worn   by the crown prince ,46,positive
10229,Katara,you mean  after all roku and sozin went through together  even after roku showed him mercy  sozin betrayed him like that  ,46,positive
10230,Toph,  its like these people are born bad ,46,positive
10231,Aang,  no  thats wrong  i dont think that was the point of what roku showed me at all ,46,positive
10232,Sokka,  then what was the point ,46,positive
10233,Aang,  roku was just as much fire nation as sozin was  right  if anything  their story proves anyones capable of great good and great evil    everyone  even the fire lord and the fire nation have to be treated like theyre worth giving a chance    and i also think it was about friendships ,46,positive
10234,Toph,  do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime ,46,positive
10235,Aang,  i dont see why not ,46,positive
10237,Sokka,well  scientifically speaking  theres no way to prove that    ,46,positive
10238,Katara,  oh  sokka  just hold hands ,46,positive

10471,Sokka,  whered she go ,48,positive
10472,Katara,no one knows  ninis house stands empty to this day  but sometimes  people see smoke coming up from the chimney  like little nini is still trying to get warm ,48,positive

10497,Katara,that mr  yao seems to have a thing for you  maybe we should go back and see if hell give us some free komodo sausages ,48,positive
10505,Sokka,people disappearing in the woods  weird stuff happening during full moons  this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans ,48,positive
10506,Aang,i bet if we take a little walk around town  well find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad ,48,positive
10507,Sokka,  and then you can sew up this little mystery lickety split  avatar style ,48,positive
10508,Aang,  helping people     thats what i do ,48,positive
10511,Sokka,  this is a mysterious little town you have here ,48,positive
10514,Sokka,that hama seems a little strange  like she knows something  or shes hiding something ,48,positive
10515,Katara,  thats ridiculous  shes a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay    she kinda reminds me of gran gran ,48,positive
10516,Sokka,but what did she mean by that comment   mysterious children  ,48,positive
10517,Katara,gee  i dont know  maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night  isnt that a little mysterious ,48,positive
10518,Sokka,im gonna take a look around   ,48,positive
10519,Katara,  sokka  sokka  what are you doing    you cant just snoop around someones house ,48,positive

10527,Sokka,just an ordinary puppet loving innkeeper  huh  well then why does she have a locked door up here ,48,positive
10528,Katara,  probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff ,48,positive
10529,Sokka,well see    its empty  except for a little chest ,48,positive
10530,Toph,maybe its treasure ,48,positive
10532,Katara,  sokka  what are you doing  youre breaking into a private room ,48,positive
10533,Sokka,i have to see whats in there ,48,positive

10558,Katara,i knew i felt a bond with you right away ,48,positive

10562,Aang,  id steer clear of the sea prunes ,48,positive
10563,Toph,i thought they were ocean kumquats ,48,positive
10564,Aang,close enough ,48,positive
10567,Katara,  youre a waterbender    ive never met another waterbender from our tribe ,48,positive
10570,Sokka,so how did you end up out here ,48,positive

10589,Katara,i cant tell you what it means to meet you  its an honor  youre a hero ,48,positive
10591,Katara,yes  yes  of course  to learn about my heritage  it would mean everything to me ,48,positive
10594,Katara,i know  when we were stranded in the desert  i felt like there was almost nothing i could do ,48,positive
10596,Katara,ive even used my own sweat for waterbending ,48,positive
10601,Aang,this has got to be the nicest natural setting in the fire nation  i dont see anything that would make a spirit mad around here ,48,positive
10603,Toph,maybe the moon spirit just turned mean ,48,positive
10604,Sokka,  the moon spirit is a gentle  loving lady  she rules the sky with compassion and     lunar goodness ,48,positive
10605,Aang,  excuse me  sir  can you tell us anything about the spirit thats been stealing people ,48,positive
10607,Toph,where does old man ding live ,48,positive
10609,Katara,wow  these flowers are beautiful ,48,positive
10611,Katara,i met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside ,48,positive
10614,Katara,that was incredible    its a shame about the lilies  though ,48,positive
10616,Katara,  but isnt that dangerous  i thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon ,48,positive
10619,Aang,old man ding ,48,positive
10623,Sokka,  we wanted to ask you about that ,48,positive
10624,Aang,did you get a good look at the spirit that took you ,48,positive

11074,Katara,dont be crazy sokka ,50,positive
11075,Sokka,maybe i am a little crazy  but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does ,50,positive
11077,Katara,i still think youre crazy  but im proud of you too ,50,positive
11078,Sokka,  yip yip ,50,positive
11080,Sokka,listen up  everyone  i want the tanks in wedge formation  warriors and benders in the middle  were taking that tower  and heading for the royal palace    charge ,50,positive
11082,Aang,  thats strange    the avatar is back    hello  anyone home ,50,positive
11087,Aang,no    no  no  no  fire lord ozai  where are you  ,50,positive
11090,Sokka,  dad    youre on your feet again ,51,positive
11092,Sokka,everythings going smoothly and the eclipse hasnt even kicked in yet ,51,positive
11094,Katara,  yeah  is that     is that aang ,51,positive
11095,Sokka,  what    please tell me youre here because the fire lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didnt even need the eclipse to take him down ,51,positive
11096,Aang,  he wasnt home  no one was  the entire palace city is abandoned ,51,positive
11097,Sokka,  they knew ,51,positive
11099,Aang,  its over  the fire lord is probably long gone  far away on some remote island where hell be safe during the eclipse ,51,positive
11100,Sokka,  no  my instincts tell me he wouldnt go too far  he would have a secret bunker  somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation ,51,positive
11101,Toph,if its an underground secret bunker were looking for    im just the girl to find it ,51,positive
11102,Sokka,  the mechanist gave me this timing device  it looks like weve got about ten minutes until the full eclipse  ten minutes to find the fire lord ,51,positive
11103,Aang,we can still do this  we can still win the day ,51,positive
11104,Katara,  wait  if they knew we were coming it could all be a trap    maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely ,51,positive
11106,Sokka,  what do you think  youre the one that has to face the fire lord  whatever you decide  im with you ,51,positive
11107,Aang,  ive gotta try ,51,positive
11109,Aang,do you feel anything down there ,51,positive
11110,Toph,  yep  there are natural tunnels criss crossing through the inside of the volcano ,51,positive
11111,Sokka,anything else  is there a structure somewhere ,51,positive
11112,Toph,  there is something big  dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano ,51,positive
11113,Sokka,  sounds like a secret bunker to me ,51,positive
11115,Aang,  stay safe  well be back soon ,51,positive
11117,Toph,  this way  that ones a dead end ,51,positive
11118,Sokka,  what would we do without you ,51,positive
11119,Toph,  perish in burning hot magma ,51,positive
11120,Sokka,  yeah  pretty much ,51,positive
11122,Toph,the tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker ,51,positive
11123,Sokka,well have to be fast  but careful ,51,positive
11125,Aang,how is that careful ,51,positive
11126,Sokka,i was wrong  we need to be fast  careful and lucky ,51,positive
11128,Sokka,theres no floor  its just a river of lava ,51,positive
11129,Aang,  climb aboard and hold on tight ,51,positive
11131,Sokka,  thats some door ,51,positive
11132,Toph,  not a problem ,51,positive
11134,Sokka,  i am so glad we added you to the group ,51,positive
11140,Katara,  we can wait here if you want ,51,positive
11144,Aang,  thanks ,51,positive
11146,Sokka,only thirty seconds until the total eclipse ,51,positive
11148,Aang,im ready  im ready to face the fire lord ,51,positive
11150,Azula,so  you are alive after all    i had a hunch that you survived  but it doesnt matter    ive known about the invasion for months ,51,positive
11152,Zuko,  im ready to face you ,51,positive
11159,Zuko,im here to tell the truth ,51,positive
11162,Zuko,first of all  in ba sing se  it was azula who took down the avatar  not me ,51,positive
11164,Zuko,because the avatars not dead  he survived ,51,positive
11166,Zuko,in fact  hes probably leading this invasion  he could be on his way here right now ,51,positive
11168,Zuko,thats another thing  im not taking orders from you anymore ,51,positive
11170,Zuko,  think again  i am going to speak my mind  and you are going to listen ,51,positive
11172,Aang,where is he  wheres the fire lord ,51,positive
11173,Azula,  you mean im not good enough for you    youre hurting my feelings ,51,positive
11174,Sokka,stop wasting our time and give us the information    youre powerless right now  so youre in no position to refuse ,51,positive
11175,Toph,  and stick to the truth  ill be able to tell if youre lying ,51,positive
11176,Azula,  are you sure  im a pretty good liar    i am a four hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings ,51,positive
11177,Toph,  okay  youre good  i admit it    but you ought to consider telling the truth anyway ,51,positive
11179,Azula,  when i left ba sing se i brought home some souvenirs  dai li agents ,51,positive
11187,Katara,  its not over yet ,51,positive
11189,Zuko,for so long  all i wanted was for you to love me  to accept me  i thought it was my honor i wanted  but really  i was just trying to please you  you  my father  who banished me just for talking out of turn    my father  who challenged me  a thirteen year old boy  to an agni kai    how could you possibly justify a duel with a child ,51,positive
11191,Zuko,it was cruel  and it was wrong ,51,positive
11193,Zuko,no  ive learned everything  and ive had to learn it on my own  growing up  we were taught that the fire nation was the greatest civilization in history  and somehow  the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world  what an amazing lie that was  the people of the world are terrified by the fire nation  they dont see our greatness  they hate us  and we deserve it    weve created an era of fear in the world  and if we dont want the world to destroy itself    we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness ,51,positive
11195,Zuko,yes    he has ,51,positive
11197,Aang,  i cant pin her down  shes too quick ,51,positive
11199,Sokka,  wait  aang  toph  stop attacking  dont you see what shes doing  shes just playing with us  shes not even trying to win this fight ,51,positive
11200,Azula,  not true  im giving it my all ,51,positive
11201,Toph,  youre trying to keep us here and waste all our time ,51,positive
11202,Azula,  um  right  i think your friend just said that  genius  and since you cant see  i should tell you im rolling my eyes   ,51,positive
11203,Toph,  ill roll your whole head ,51,positive
11204,Sokka,shes just baiting you again ,51,positive
11205,Aang,okay  so what do we do  just ignore her ,51,positive
11206,Sokka,we dont have a choice  we just have to get out of here and find the fire lord on our own somehow ,51,positive
11208,Azula,  its a trap  dont say i didnt warn you ,51,positive
11210,Sokka,  ignore ,51,positive
11211,Azula,  so  sokkas your name  right  my favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time    she was convinced you were going to come rescue her  of course you never came  and she gave up on you ,51,positive
11213,Azula,  come and get it ,51,positive
11215,Sokka,where  is  suki  ,51,positive
11217,Zuko,after i leave here today  im gonna free uncle iroh from his prison and im gonna beg for his forgiveness    hes the one whos been a real father to me ,51,positive
11219,Zuko,but ive come to an even more important decision    im going to join the avatar and im going to help him defeat you ,51,positive
11221,Zuko,because i know my own destiny  taking you down is the avatars destiny    goodbye ,51,positive
11224,Zuko,what happened that night ,51,positive
11227,Sokka,wheres suki  answer me ,51,positive
11228,Aang,  sokka  she wont talk ,51,positive
11229,Sokka,  where are you keeping her ,51,positive
11232,Zuko,  so shes alive ,51,positive
11235,Azula,oh  sounds like the firebendings back on ,51,positive
11237,Azula,  dads all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left  im sure hed be more than happy to see you now ,51,positive
11239,Sokka,  i fell for it  i used up all our time ,51,positive
11240,Toph,its not your fault  sokka  azula was ready for us  she had every move planned out ,51,positive
11241,Sokka,  and now its too late ,51,positive
11242,Aang,maybe its not too late  the eclipse is over  but i can face the fire lord anyway ,51,positive
11243,Sokka,  no  i dont think thats a good idea ,51,positive
11244,Aang,but im ready  i came here with a job to do and everyones counting on me ,51,positive
11245,Toph,the fire lord knew we were coming this time  we thought we had surprise on our side but we didnt  it just wasnt our day  what we need to do now is go and help our friends ,51,positive
11246,Aang,  i guess you guys are right ,51,positive
11247,Sokka,  youll have another chance  i know you will ,51,positive
11254,Katara,theyre back ,51,positive
11256,Sokka,  it was all a trap  azula knew we were coming and shes plotted out every move    weve just got to get to the beach as fast as we can    if we can make it to the submarines  maybe we can get away safely ,51,positive
11257,Aang,theyve got air power  but so do i    im gonna do what i can to slow them down   ,51,positive
11258,Katara,appa  you and i can help too   ,51,positive
11260,Sokka,everyone  lets get back to the subs   ,51,positive
11262,Katara,we cant keep them all back  theres too many of them ,51,positive
11263,Aang,lets join the others   ,51,positive
11265,Zuko,uncle    where is my uncle ,51,positive
11268,Sokka,try and find cover  i think were about to see some bombs ,51,positive
11270,Katara,why arent they turning around to attack us again ,51,positive
11271,Aang,  theyre heading for the beach       theyre gonna destroy the submarines ,51,positive
11272,Sokka,  how are we all going to escape ,51,positive
11274,Sokka,  then our only choice is to stand and fight  we have the avatar  we could still win ,51,positive
11276,Katara,  what    we cant leave you behind    we wont leave anyone behind ,51,positive
11280,Sokka,  theyre at the beach already ,51,positive
11291,Katara,well miss you  dad   ,51,positive
11292,Sokka,bye  dad  we wont be apart for too long this time  i promise ,51,positive
11294,Aang,thank you all for being so brave and so strong  im gonna make this up to you ,51,positive
11297,Azula,no  theyre too fast  it doesnt matter  theyll be back   ,51,positive
11298,Aang,  i know just the place for us to go where well be safe for a while  the western air temple ,51,positive
11301,Katara,this is humiliating ,52,positive
11302,Sokka,  you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the fire nation or having to walk all the way to the western air temple ,52,positive
11303,Katara,  both ,52,positive
11305,Aang,  sorry guys  but appa gets tired carrying all these people ,52,positive
11311,Sokka,i miss not having blisters on my feet ,52,positive
11313,Toph,hey  were here  i can feel it ,52,positive
11315,Katara,uhhh     i think your feet need their eyes checked ,52,positive
11317,Aang,no  shes right  we are here ,52,positive
11319,Toph,wow     its amazing ,52,positive
11321,Iroh,what a stunning view ,52,positive
11323,Zuko,the only view im interested in seeing is the avatar in chains ,52,positive
11324,Iroh,you know  the avatar hasnt been seen for one hundred years  the chances of finding him here are very slim   ,52,positive
11325,Zuko,  first well check each of the air temples  then well scour the world  searching even the most remote locations until we find him ,52,positive
11326,Iroh,prince zuko  its only been a week since your banishment  you should take some time to heal and rest ,52,positive
11327,Zuko,what else would i expect to hear from the laziest man in the fire nation    the only way to regain my honor is to find the avatar  so i will ,52,positive
11332,Katara,you guys go  i think we need to talk about some things ,52,positive
11336,Aang,why cant i go ,52,positive
11337,Katara,we need to decide what were gonna do now  and since youre the avatar  maybe you should be a part of this ,52,positive
11338,Aang,  fair enough  so  whats the new plan ,52,positive
11339,Sokka,well  if you ask me  the new plan is the old plan  you just need to master all four elements and confront the fire lord before the comet comes ,52,positive
11340,Aang,  oh  yeah  thats great  no problem  ill just do that ,52,positive
11341,Katara,aang  no one said its going to be easy ,52,positive
11342,Aang,well  its not even gonna be possible  where am i supposed to get a firebending teacher ,52,positive
11343,Katara,we could look for jeong jeong ,52,positive
11344,Aang,  yeah     right    like well ever run into jeong jeong again ,52,positive
11345,Toph,  whos     oh    never mind  if its important ill find out ,52,positive
11346,Aang,oh well  guess we cant come up with anybody  why dont we just take a nice tour around the temple   ,52,positive
11347,Toph,whats up with him ,52,positive
11348,Sokka,theres gotta be someone who can teach him firebending ,52,positive
11350,Zuko,hello       zuko here  but i guess   you probably already know me  sort of  uhhh     so  the thing is i have a lot of firebending experience  and im   considered to be pretty good at it    well  youve seen me  you know  when i was attacking you    uhhh     yeah  i guess   i should apologize for that  but anyway    im good now    i mean  i thought i was good before  but i realize i was bad    but anyway  i think its time i joined your group and taught   the avatar firebending    well  whats your answer    yeah     thats what id say  too  how am i supposed to convince these people that im on their side  what would uncle do    zuko  you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self  only then will your true self  reveal itself    even when im talking for him i cant figure out what he means  what would azula do    listen  avatar  i can join your group  or i can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends  your choice    i guess im just not that good at impersonations ,52,positive
11352,Katara,aang  can we talk about you learning firebending now ,52,positive
11353,Aang,what  the wind is too loud in my ears  check out this loop ,52,positive
11355,Sokka,aang  i think we should be making some plans about our future ,52,positive
11356,Aang,okay  we can do that while i show you the giant pai sho table  oh  youre gonna love the all day echo chamber ,52,positive
11357,Toph,  i think thatll have to wait ,52,positive
11359,Zuko,  hello       zuko here ,52,positive
11361,Zuko,hey  i heard you guys flying around down there  so  i just thought id wait for you here    i know you must be surprised to see me here ,52,positive
11362,Sokka,not really  since youve followed us all over the world ,52,positive
11363,Zuko,right  well  uhhh     anyway     what i wanted to tell you about is that ive changed  and i  uhhh  im good now  and well i think i should join your group  oh  and i can teach firebending to you    see  i  uhhh    ,52,positive
11364,Toph,you want to what now ,52,positive
11365,Katara,you cant possibly think that any of us would trust you  can you  i mean  how stupid do you think we are  ,52,positive
11366,Sokka,yeah  all youve ever done is hunt us down and try to capture aang ,52,positive
11367,Zuko,ive done some good things  i mean  i could have stolen your bison in ba sing se  but i set him free  thats something   ,52,positive
11368,Toph,appa   does seem to like him ,52,positive
11369,Sokka,he probably just covered himself in honey or something so that appa would lick him  im not buying it ,52,positive
11370,Zuko,i can understand why you wouldnt trust me  and i know ive made some mistakes in the past ,52,positive
11371,Sokka,like when you attacked our village ,52,positive
11372,Katara,or when you stole my mothers necklace and used it to track us down and capture us ,52,positive
11373,Zuko,look  i admit ive some awful things  i was wrong to try to capture you  and im sorry that i attacked the water tribe  and i never should have sent that fire nation assassin after you    im going to try and stop ,52,positive
11374,Sokka,  wait  you sent combustion man after us ,52,positive
11375,Zuko,well  thats not his name  but ,52,positive
11376,Sokka,  ohhh  sorry  i didnt mean to insult your friend ,52,positive
11377,Zuko,  hes not my friend ,52,positive
11378,Toph,that guy locked me and katara in jail and tried to blow us all up ,52,positive
11379,Zuko,  why arent you saying anything  you once said you thought we could be friends  you know i have good in me ,52,positive
11381,Aang,theres no way we can trust you after everything youve done  well never let you join us ,52,positive
11382,Katara,you need to get out of here  now ,52,positive
11383,Zuko,im trying to explain that im not that person anymore ,52,positive
11384,Sokka,either you leave  or we attack ,52,positive
11385,Zuko,if you wont accept me as a friend  then maybe youll take me as a prisoner   ,52,positive
11386,Katara,no  we wont    get out of here  and dont come back  and if we ever see you again  well  wed better not see you again ,52,positive
11388,Zuko,uggh  i cant believe how stupid i am  i mean  what was i thinking  telling them i sent an assassin after them  why didnt i just say azula did that  they would have believed that  stupid    uggh ,52,positive
11390,Katara,why would he try to fool us like that ,52,positive
11391,Sokka,obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap ,52,positive
11392,Katara,this is just like when we were in prison together at ba sing se  he starts talking about his mother and making it seem like hes an actual human being with feelings ,52,positive
11393,Sokka,he wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down  then he strikes ,52,positive
11394,Katara,the thing is  it worked  i did feel sorry for him  i felt like he was really confused and hurt  but obviously  when the time came  he made his choice  and we paid the price  we cant trust him ,52,positive
11395,Aang,i kind of have a confession to make  remember when you two were sick and i got captured by zhao ,52,positive
11396,Sokka,and you made us suck on frozen frogs  how could i forget  i had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month ,52,positive
11397,Katara,sokka  i looked at it  and i told you  there was nothing there ,52,positive
11398,Sokka,i could feel it  its my throatal flap ,52,positive
11399,Aang,anyway  when zhao had me chained up  it was zuko who came in and got me out  he risked his life to save me ,52,positive
11400,Katara,no way  im sure he only did it so he could capture you himself ,52,positive
11401,Sokka,yeah  face it aang  youre nothing but a big prize to him ,52,positive
11402,Aang,youre probably right ,52,positive
11403,Katara,and what was all that crazy stuff about setting appa free  what a liar ,52,positive
11404,Toph,actually  he wasnt lying ,52,positive
11405,Sokka,  oh  hooray  in a lifetime of evil  at least he didnt add animal cruelty to the list ,52,positive
11406,Toph,im just saying that  considering his messed up family and how he was raised  he could have turned out a lot worse ,52,positive
11407,Katara,  youre right  toph  lets go find him and give him a medal  the  not as much of a jerk as you could have been  award ,52,positive
11408,Toph,all i know is that while he was talking to us  he was sincere  maybe youre all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly ,52,positive
11409,Katara,easy for you to say  you werent there when he had us attacked by pirates ,52,positive
11410,Sokka,or when he burned down kyoshi island ,52,positive
11411,Aang,or when he tried to capture me at the fire temple ,52,positive
11412,Katara,why would you even try to defend him ,52,positive
11413,Toph,  because katara  youre all ignoring one crucial fact    aang needs a firebending teacher  we cant think of a single person in the world to do the job  now one shows up on a silver platter  and you wont even think about it   ,52,positive
11414,Aang,im not having zuko as my teacher ,52,positive
11415,Sokka,youre darn right youre not  buddy ,52,positive
11416,Katara,well  i guess that settles that ,52,positive
11417,Toph,ergh  im beginning to wonder whos really the blind one around here   ,52,positive
11419,Zuko,whos there  stay back   ,52,positive
11420,Toph,its me    ow  you burned my feet ,52,positive
11421,Zuko,im sorry  it was a mistake   ,52,positive
11422,Toph,get away from me   ,52,positive
11423,Zuko,let me help you    im sorry   ,52,positive
11424,Toph,get off me  get off me   ,52,positive
11425,Zuko,i didnt know it was you  uggh  come back    uggh  why am i so bad at being good ,52,positive
11427,Katara,  has anyone seen toph ,52,positive
11428,Sokka,i havent seen her since she stormed off yesterday ,52,positive
11430,Katara,i think we should go look for her ,52,positive
11431,Sokka,  let her have fun with her rocks  im in no rush to have her yelling at us again ,52,positive
11436,Katara,  toph  what happened ,52,positive
11437,Toph,my feet got burned ,52,positive
11438,Katara,oh no  what happened ,52,positive
11439,Toph,i just told you  my feet got burned ,52,positive
11440,Katara,i meant  how ,52,positive
11441,Toph,well  i kind of went to see zuko last night   ,52,positive
11442,Aang,you what ,52,positive
11443,Katara,zuko ,52,positive
11444,Sokka,uhhh     ,52,positive
11445,Toph,i thought he could be helpful to us    and if i talked to him  maybe we could work something out ,52,positive
11446,Sokka,so he attacked you ,52,positive
11447,Toph,well  he did  and he didnt  it was sort of an accident ,52,positive
11448,Aang,but he did firebend at you ,52,positive
11449,Toph,  yes ,52,positive
11450,Sokka,see  you trusted zuko  and you got burned  literally ,52,positive
11451,Katara,its gonna take a while for your feet to get better    i wish i could have worked on them sooner ,52,positive
11452,Toph,yeah  me too ,52,positive
11453,Sokka,zukos clearly too dangerous to be left alone  were gonna have to go after him ,52,positive
11454,Aang,i hate to go looking for a fight  but youre right  after what he did to toph  i dont think we have a choice ,52,positive
11455,Sokka,hes crafty  but well find a way to capture him ,52,positive
11456,Toph,maybe just invite him back here    hes already offered himself up as a prisoner once ,52,positive
11457,Sokka,yeah  get him to come back and say hell be our prisoner  then well jump him and really make him our prisoner  hell never suspect it   ,52,positive
11458,Katara,  you are a master of surprise  sokka    ,52,positive
11460,Toph,ahhh  thats the stuff  now i know how the rest of you guys feel  not being able to see with your feet stinks   ,52,positive
11462,Zuko,stop    i dont want you hunting the avatar anymore    the mission is off  im ordering you to stop ,52,positive
11464,Zuko,if you keep attacking  i wont pay you    all right  ill pay you double to stop ,52,positive
11466,Toph,hes going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side ,52,positive
11468,Katara,i cant step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and i cant get a good enough angle on him from down here ,52,positive
11469,Sokka,  i know how to get an angle on him    all right buddy  dont fail me now   ,52,positive
11471,Sokka,yeah  boomerang    awww  boomerang    ,52,positive
11474,Aang,i cant believe im saying this  but     thanks  zuko ,52,positive
11475,Sokka,hey  what about me  i did the boomerang thing ,52,positive
11476,Zuko,listen  i know i didnt explain myself very well yesterday  ive been through a lot in the last few years  and its been hard  but im realizing that i had to go through all those things to learn the truth  i thought i had lost my honor  and that somehow my father could return it to me  but i know now that no one can give you your honor  its something you earn for yourself  by choosing to do whats right  all i want to do now is play my part in ending this war  and i know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world    im sorry for what i did to you    it was an accident  fire can be dangerous and wild  so as a firebender  i need to be more careful and control my bending  so i dont hurt people unintentionally ,52,positive
11477,Aang,  i think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher  when i first tried to learn firebending  i burned katara  and after that  i never wanted to firebend again  but now i know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love  id like you to teach me   ,52,positive
11478,Zuko,  thank you  im so happy youve accepted me into your group ,52,positive
11479,Aang,not so fast  i still have to ask my friends if its okay with them    toph  youre the one that zuko burned  what do you think ,52,positive
11480,Toph,go ahead and let him join    itll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet ,52,positive
11481,Aang,  sokka ,52,positive
11482,Sokka,  hey  all i want is to defeat the fire lord  if you think this is the way to do it  then  im all for it ,52,positive
11483,Aang,  katara ,52,positive
11484,Katara,  ill go along with whatever you think is right   ,52,positive
11485,Zuko,  i wont let you down  i promise ,52,positive
11487,Sokka,so  here you go  home sweet home  i guess  you know  for now  unpack  lunch  soon  uhhh     welcome aboard    yeah    okay  this is really  really weird ,52,positive
11489,Zuko,if i have to  i will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the avatar  i know its my destiny to capture him ,52,positive
11490,Iroh,  you know prince zuko  destiny is a funny thing  you never know how things are going to work out  but if you keep an open mind  and an open heart  i promise you will find your own destiny someday ,52,positive
11492,Katara,you might have everyone else here buying your     transformation  but you and i both know youve struggled with doing the right thing in the past    so let me tell you something  right now  you make one step backward    one slip up  give me one reason to think you might hurt aang  and you wont have to worry about your destiny anymore    because ill make sure your destiny ends     right then and there  permanently ,52,positive
11496,Zuko,i know youre nervous  but remember  firebending in it of itself is not something to fear ,53,positive
11497,Aang,  okay  not something to fear ,53,positive
11498,Zuko,  but if you dont respect it    itll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino ,53,positive
11500,Zuko,now show me what youve got  any amount of fire you can make ,53,positive
11502,Aang,maybe i need a little more instruction  perhaps a demonstration ,53,positive
11503,Zuko,  good idea  you might wanna take a couple steps back ,53,positive
11505,Zuko,  what was that  that was the worst firebending ive ever seen ,53,positive
11506,Aang,  i thought it was     nice   ,53,positive
11508,Zuko,  why is this happening ,53,positive
11509,Aang,  maybe its the altitude ,53,positive
11510,Zuko,  yeah  could be ,53,positive
11512,Zuko,just breathe  and      ,53,positive
11513,Aang,  that one kind of felt hot ,53,positive
11514,Zuko,  dont patronize me  you know what its supposed to look like ,53,positive
11515,Aang,sorry  sifu hotman ,53,positive
11516,Zuko,  and stop calling me that ,53,positive
11518,Sokka,hey  jerks  mind if i watch you two jerks do your jerkbending ,53,positive
11519,Zuko,  get out of here   ,53,positive
11520,Sokka,okay  take it easy    i was just kiddin around    jerkbending  still got it   ,53,positive
11522,Zuko,listen everybody  ive got some pretty bad news  ive lost my stuff   ,53,positive
11523,Toph,  dont look at me    i didnt touch your stuff ,53,positive
11524,Zuko,im talking about my firebending  its gone   ,53,positive
11526,Katara,im sorry  im just laughing at the irony  you know  how it wouldve been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago ,53,positive
11527,Zuko,  well  its not lost  its just     weaker for some reason ,53,positive
11528,Katara,  maybe youre not as good as you think you are ,53,positive
11529,Toph,  ouch   ,53,positive
11530,Zuko,  i bet its because i changed sides ,53,positive
11531,Katara,  thats ridiculous   ,53,positive
11532,Aang,i dont know  maybe it isnt  maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just dont have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to ,53,positive
11533,Sokka,  sooo  all we need to do is make zuko angry  easy enough ,53,positive
11535,Zuko,okay  cut it out    look  even if youre right  i dont want to rely on hate and anger anymore  there has to be another way ,53,positive
11536,Toph,  youre gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source  i recommend the original source   ,53,positive
11537,Sokka,  hows he supposed to do that   by jumping into a volcano  ,53,positive
11538,Toph,no  zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is ,53,positive
11539,Sokka,  so  is it jumping into a volcano ,53,positive
11540,Toph,i dont know    for earthbending  the original benders were badgermoles ,53,positive
11542,Toph,  one day  when i was little  i ran away and hid in a cave ,53,positive
11544,Toph,thats where i met them ,53,positive
11546,Toph,they were blind  just like me    so we understood each other  i was able to learn earthbending    not just as a martial art  but as an extension of my senses    for them  the original earthbenders    it wasnt just about fighting  it was their way of interacting with the world   ,53,positive
11548,Aang,thats amazing  toph ,53,positive
11549,Aang,  i learned from the monks  but the original airbenders were the sky bison    maybe you can give me a lesson sometime  buddy ,53,positive
11551,Zuko,well  this doesnt help me  the original firebenders were the dragons  and theyre extinct ,53,positive
11552,Aang,  what do you mean   roku had a dragon  and there were plenty of dragons when i was a kid ,53,positive
11553,Zuko,  well  they arent around anymore  okay ,53,positive
11554,Aang,okay  okay    im sorry ,53,positive
11555,Zuko,but maybe theres another way    the first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient sun warriors ,53,positive
11556,Aang,  sun warriors  well  i know they werent around when i was a kid ,53,positive
11557,Zuko,  no  they died off thousands of years ago  but their civilization wasnt too far from where we are now    maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins ,53,positive
11558,Aang,its like the monks used to tell me  sometimes  the shadows of the past can be felt by the present ,53,positive
11559,Sokka,so  what    maybe youll pick up some super old sun warrior energy just by standing   where they stood a thousand years ago ,53,positive
11560,Zuko,  more or less  either i find a new way to firebend    or the avatar has to find a new teacher   ,53,positive
11562,Zuko,weve been riding for hours  i dont know why  but i thought this thing would be a lot faster ,53,positive
11564,Aang,  appas right  zuko  in our group  typically we start our missions with a more up beat attitude ,53,positive
11565,Zuko,  i cant believe this   ,53,positive
11566,Aang,  dont worry  youll get the hang of it ,53,positive
11568,Aang and Zuko,whoa ,53,positive
11570,Zuko,even though these buildings are ancient  theres something eerily familiar about them    i can tell the fire sages temples are somehow descended from these ,53,positive
11571,Aang,  okay  weve learned something about architecture    hopefully  well learn something about firebending too  the past can be a great teacher ,53,positive
11573,Aang,  zuko  i think the past is trying to kill me ,53,positive
11574,Zuko,  i cant believe it    this booby trap must be centuries old and it still works ,53,positive
11575,Aang,theres probably a lot more  maybe this means we shouldnt be here ,53,positive
11577,Zuko,  wheres that up beat attitude you were talkin about    besides  people dont make traps unless theyve got something worth protecting ,53,positive
11579,Aang,look  this seems promising    though im not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending ,53,positive
11580,Zuko,  they look pretty angry to me ,53,positive
11581,Aang,  i thought the dragons were friends with the sun warriors ,53,positive
11582,Zuko,well  they had a funny way of showing it ,53,positive
11584,Aang,zuko    something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years    something youre not telling me ,53,positive
11585,Zuko,  my great grandfather sozin happened ,53,positive
11587,Zuko,he started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory  there were the ultimate firebenders    and if you could conquer one  your firebending talents would become legendary and youd earn the honorary title  dragon    the last great dragon was conquered long before i was born    by my uncle ,53,positive
11588,Aang,  but i thought your uncle was     i dont know  good ,53,positive
11589,Zuko,he had a complicated past    family tradition  i guess  lets just move on ,53,positive
11591,Aang,its locked up ,53,positive
11593,Zuko,wait    its a celestial calendar    just like the fire sages have in their temples    i bet that sunstone opens the door  but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle    on the solstice ,53,positive
11594,Aang,  monkeyfeathers  the solstice again  we cant wait here that long ,53,positive
11595,Zuko,  no  we cant    but we might be able to speed time up    lets see if we can outsmart the sunstone ,53,positive
11597,Aang,nothings happening ,53,positive
11598,Zuko,  come on    ,53,positive
11600,Aang,  you know  zuko  i dont care what everyone else says about you    youre pretty smart ,53,positive
11602,Zuko,relax  theyre just statues ,53,positive
11604,Aang,it says this is something called the dancing dragon ,53,positive
11606,Aang,zuko  get over here  i want you to dance with me ,53,positive
11607,Zuko,  what ,53,positive
11608,Aang,just do it ,53,positive
11610,Aang,lets follow the steps of the statues    dont you see  these arent dance moves  these statues are giving us a lesson    i think this is some kind of sun warrior firebending form ,53,positive
11611,Zuko,this better teach us some really good firebending ,53,positive
11613,Aang,hurray    wait  what exactly is that ,53,positive
11614,Zuko,  its some kind of mystical gemstone ,53,positive
11615,Aang,  well  dont touch it   ,53,positive
11616,Zuko,why not ,53,positive
11617,Aang,remember what happened out there with those spikes    im just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals ,53,positive
11619,Zuko,it feels almost alive ,53,positive
11621,Aang,  oh no  its another trap ,53,positive
11623,Zuko,ugh  i cant pull free  its like some kind of glue ,53,positive
11625,Aang,  i cant move  zuko  do something ,53,positive
11626,Zuko,me  i cant move either ,53,positive
11628,Aang,it stopped ,53,positive
11629,Zuko,at least we have air  maybe if we stay calm  we can figure a way out of this ,53,positive
11631,Aang,you had to pick up the glowing egg  didnt you ,53,positive
11632,Zuko,  at least i made something happen  if it were up to you  wed never have made it past the courtyard ,53,positive
11633,Aang,  help ,53,positive
11634,Zuko,who are you yelling to  nobodys lived here for centuries ,53,positive
11635,Aang,well  what do you think we should do ,53,positive
11636,Zuko,think about our place in the universe  ,53,positive
11641,Zuko,  we didnt come here to take your sunstone  we came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending ,53,positive
11644,Aang,please  i dont normally play this card  but       im the avatar    just hear us out ,53,positive
11645,Zuko,  my name is zuko  crown prince of the fire nation    o or at least i used to be    i know my people have distorted the ways of firebending  to be fueled by anger and rage  but now i want to learn the true way    the original way  when we came here  i never imagined   the sun warriors civilization was secretly alive  i am truly humbled to be in your presence    please  teach us ,53,positive
11647,Aang,  ran and shaw  there are two of them ,53,positive
11651,Zuko,  i dont believe it ,53,positive
11653,Aang,  umm  mister sun chief sir   yeah  im not a firebender yet    couldnt my friend here carry my fire for me ,53,positive
11656,Aang,im sorry  im just a little nervous    its like a little heartbeat ,53,positive
11659,Zuko,hurry up ,53,positive
11660,Aang,i cant    if i walk too fast  my flame will go out   ,53,positive
11661,Zuko,your flames   gonna go out   because its too small  youre too timid  give it more juice ,53,positive
11662,Aang,  but what if i cant control it ,53,positive
11663,Zuko,  you can do it  i know you can    youre a talented kid ,53,positive
11667,Aang,but once they find out im the avatar    ,53,positive
11670,Aang,  we could turn back now  weve already learned more about fire than wed hoped   ,53,positive
11671,Zuko,no  were seeing this through to the end  were gonna meet these masters and find out   whats so great about them ,53,positive
11672,Aang,  what if they judge us  and attack us ,53,positive
11673,Zuko,  well  were the fire prince and the avatar    i think we could take these guys in a fight  whoever they are   ,53,positive
11675,Zuko,bring em out ,53,positive
11682,Aang,whats happening     zuko  my fire went out ,53,positive
11683,Zuko,  what do you want me to do  ,53,positive
11684,Aang,give me some of yours   ,53,positive
11685,Zuko,  no  just make your own ,53,positive
11686,Aang,  i cant   ,53,positive
11687,Zuko,  get some from those warriors    hurry    stop cheating off me ,53,positive
11689,Aang,  quit being stingy ,53,positive
11691,Aang,uh oh ,53,positive
11693,Zuko,  these are the masters ,53,positive
11694,Aang,  still think we can take em ,53,positive
11695,Zuko,sshh  i never said that ,53,positive
11701,Aang,  zuko  i think were supposed to do the dragon dance with them ,53,positive
11702,Zuko,  what   what about this situation makes you think they want us to dance  ,53,positive
11703,Aang,well  i think they want us to do something  lets just try it ,53,positive
11704,Zuko,  fine ,53,positive
11708,Aang,wow ,53,positive
11709,Zuko,  i understand ,53,positive
11711,Zuko,  their fire was beautiful  i saw so many colors  colors ive never imagined ,53,positive
11712,Aang,  like firebending harmony ,53,positive
11714,Zuko,  i cant believe there are still living dragons  my uncle iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it ,53,positive
11715,Aang,  so your uncle lied ,53,positive
11717,Zuko,  he must have lied to protect them  so no one else would hunt them ,53,positive
11718,Aang,  all this time  i thought firebending was destruction  since i hurt katara  ive been too afraid and hesitant  but now i know what it really is     its energy  and life   ,53,positive
11719,Zuko,yeah  its like the sun    but inside of you  do you guys realize this ,53,positive
11721,Zuko,thats why my firebending was so weak before  because for so many years  hunting you   was my drive     it was my purpose    so when i joined you  i lost sight of my inner fire  but now  i have a new drive    i have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world ,53,positive
11725,Aang,  with this technique the dragons showed us  zuko and i will be unstoppable ,53,positive
11727,Sokka,yeah  thats a great dance you two learned there ,53,positive

11910,Sokka,so  listen  i think i have an escape plan  i checked out the coolers again  and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained  right ,54,positive
11911,Zuko,yeah    ,54,positive
11912,Sokka,so  theyre completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in  well  to keep the cold in  it also has to keep the heat out  right ,54,positive

11915,Zuko,  the cooler as a boat  are you sure ,54,positive
11916,Sokka,im telling you  itll work    i walked around the perimeter  theres a blind spot between two guard towers  its the perfect launching point    i already tested it out  well roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current  itll take us straight across  as long as we dont make a sound  no one will notice    and bing bang boom  were home free ,54,positive
11919,Sokka,  what  we didnt     w we didnt say that ,54,positive

12300,Zuko,  stop  okay  listen  i know this may seem out of nowhere  but i want you to tell me what happened to your mother ,56,positive
12301,Sokka,  what  why would you want to know that ,56,positive
12302,Zuko,katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in ba sing se  and again just now when she was yelling at me  i think somehow shes connected her anger at that to her anger at me ,56,positive
12303,Sokka,  its not a day i like to remember ,56,positive
12305,Young Katara,im going to find mom   ,56,positive
12306,Sokka,  many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant  a fire nation raid    we were badly outnumbered  but somehow  we managed to drive them off  as quickly as they came  they just left ,56,positive
12308,Sokka,i was so relieved when it was over  but thats because i didnt know yet what had happened  i didnt know we had lost our mother ,56,positive
12309,Zuko,wait  can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village  like what the lead ship looked like ,56,positive
12310,Sokka,yeah     sea ravens    the main ship had flags with sea ravens on them ,56,positive
12311,Zuko,the symbol of the southern raiders  thanks  sokka ,56,positive

12326,Aang,um     and what exactly do you think this will accomplish ,56,positive
12327,Katara,  ugh  i knew you wouldnt understand   ,56,positive
12328,Aang,wait  stop  i do understand  youre feeling unbelievable pain and rage  how do think i felt about the sandbenders when they stole appa  how do you think i felt about the fire nation when i found out what happened to my people ,56,positive
12329,Zuko,she needs this  aang  this is about getting closure and justice ,56,positive
12330,Aang,i dont think so  i think its about getting revenge ,56,positive
12331,Katara,  fine  maybe it is  maybe thats what i need  maybe thats what he deserves ,56,positive
12332,Aang,katara  you sound like jet ,56,positive
12333,Katara,its not the same  jet attacked the innocent  this man  hes a monster ,56,positive
12334,Sokka,katara  she was my mother  too  but i think aang might be right ,56,positive
12335,Katara,then you didnt love her the way i did ,56,positive
12336,Sokka,  katara ,56,positive
12337,Aang,the monks used to say that revenge is like a two headed rat viper  while you watch your enemy go down  youre being poisoned yourself ,56,positive
12338,Zuko,thats cute  but this isnt air temple preschool  its the real world ,56,positive
12339,Katara,now that i know hes out there     now that i know we can find him  i feel like i have no choice ,56,positive
12340,Aang,katara  you do have a choice  forgiveness ,56,positive
12341,Zuko,thats the same as doing nothing ,56,positive
12342,Aang,no  its not  its easy to do nothing  but its hard to forgive ,56,positive
12343,Katara,its not just hard  its impossible   ,56,positive
12345,Aang,so you were just gonna take appa anyway ,56,positive
12346,Katara,yes ,56,positive
12347,Aang,its okay  because i forgive you    that give you any ideas ,56,positive
12348,Katara,dont try to stop us ,56,positive
12349,Aang,i wasnt planning to  this is a journey you need to take  you need to face this man    but when you do  please dont choose revenge  let your anger out  and then let it go  forgive him ,56,positive
12350,Zuko,  okay  well be sure to do that  guru goody goody   ,56,positive
12351,Katara,thanks for understanding  aang  yip yip   ,56,positive

12355,Aang,i appreciate that ,56,positive
12356,Sokka,so  can i borrow momo for a week ,56,positive
12357,Aang,  why do you need momo ,56,positive
12359,Zuko,we need to find the fire navy communication tower  all the navys movements are coordinated by messenger hawk  and every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed ,56,positive
12360,Katara,  so once we find the communication tower  we bust in and take the information we need ,56,positive
12361,Zuko,  not exactly  we need to be stealthy and make sure no one spots us    otherwise theyll warn the southern raiders long before we reach them ,56,positive
12363,Zuko,okay  southern raiders    bam    on patrol near whaletail island ,56,positive
12364,Katara,  whaletail island  here we come ,56,positive
12366,Zuko,you should get some rest  well be there in a few hours  youll need all your strength ,56,positive
12367,Katara,oh  dont you worry about my strength  i have plenty  im not the helpless little girl i was when they came ,56,positive

12382,Katara,but we were too late  when we got there  the man was gone    and so was she ,56,positive
12383,Zuko,your mother was a brave woman ,56,positive
12384,Katara,  i know ,56,positive
12386,Zuko,there    see those sea raven flags    its the southern raiders ,56,positive
12387,Katara,  lets do this ,56,positive
12391,Zuko,this is it  katara  are you ready to face him ,56,positive
12394,Zuko,you dont remember her  you will soon  trust me ,56,positive
12398,Zuko,think back  think back to your last raid on the southern water tribe ,56,positive
12400,Zuko,  dont lie  you look her in the eye and you tell me you dont remember what you did ,56,positive
12402,Katara,its not him    hes not the man ,56,positive
12403,Zuko,what  what do you mean hes not  hes the leader of the southern raiders  he has to be the guy ,56,positive
12405,Zuko,if youre not the man were looking for  who is ,56,positive
12418,Katara,that was him  that was the monster ,56,positive
12422,Zuko,we werent behind the bush    and i wouldnt try firebending again ,56,positive
12425,Katara,do you know who i am ,56,positive
12427,Katara,oh  you better remember me like your life depends on it  why dont you take a closer look   ,56,positive
12432,Young Katara,  mommy  im scared ,56,positive
12441,Katara,she lied to you    she was protecting the last waterbender ,56,positive
12443,Katara,  me ,56,positive
12446,Katara,  i always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing  but now that i see you  i think i understand  theres just nothing inside you  nothing at all  youre pathetic and sad and empty ,56,positive
12448,Katara,but as much as i hate you     i just cant do it ,56,positive
12450,Aang,katara  are you okay ,56,positive
12451,Katara,im doing fine ,56,positive
12452,Aang,zuko told me what you did  or what you didnt do  i guess  im proud of you ,56,positive
12453,Katara,i wanted to do it  i wanted to take out all my anger at him  but i couldnt  i dont know if its because im too weak to do it or because im strong enough not to ,56,positive
12454,Aang,you did the right thing  forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing ,56,positive
12455,Katara,  but i didnt forgive him  ill never forgive him    but i am ready to forgive you ,56,positive
12457,Zuko,you were right about what katara needed  violence wasnt the answer ,56,positive
12458,Aang,it never is ,56,positive
12459,Zuko,then i have a question for you    what are you gonna do when you face my father ,56,positive
12462,Katara,doesnt it seem kind of weird that were hiding from the fire lord in his own house ,57,positive
12463,Zuko,i told you    my father hasnt come here since our family was actually happy  and that was a long time ago  its the last place anyone would think to look for us ,57,positive
12465,Sokka,you guys are not gonna believe this  theres a play about us ,57,positive
12467,Katara,what  how is that possible ,57,positive
12468,Sokka,listen to this        the boy in the iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright pu on tim    who scoured the globe gathering information on the avatar  from the icy south pole to the heart of ba sing se    his sources include singing nomads  pirates  prisoners of war  and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage  ,57,positive
12470,Zuko,  ugh  my mother used to take us to see them  they butchered love amongst the dragons every year ,57,positive
12471,Katara,sokka  do you really think its a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves ,57,positive
12472,Sokka,  come on  a day at the theater  this is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense ive been missing   ,57,positive
12474,Aang,  hey  uh     i wanted to sit there ,57,positive
12475,Zuko,  just sit next to me  whats the big deal ,57,positive
12476,Aang,i was just  i wanted to     okay   ,57,positive
12478,Toph,why are we sitting in the nosebleed section  my feet cant see a thing from up here ,57,positive
12479,Katara,dont worry  ill tell your feet whats happening ,57,positive
12486,Sokka,  this is pathetic  my jokes are way funnier than this   ,57,positive
12487,Toph,  i think hes got you pegged ,57,positive
12490,Katara,  well  thats just silly  i dont sound like that ,57,positive
12491,Toph,  oh man  this writers a genius ,57,positive
12500,Aang,wait  is that a woman playing me ,57,positive
12508,Aang,  i dont do that  thats not what im like  and im not a woman   ,57,positive
12509,Toph,  oh  they nailed you  twinkle toes   ,57,positive
12517,Zuko,  they make me look totally stiff and humorless ,57,positive
12518,Katara,  actually  i think that actors pretty spot on ,57,positive
12519,Zuko,  how could you say that ,57,positive
12525,Aang,ugh ,57,positive
12551,Sokka,  shhh    im trying to watch   ,57,positive
12555,Aang,ugh ,57,positive
12557,Zuko,  so far  this intermission is the best part of the play ,57,positive
12558,Sokka,  apparently  the playwright thinks im an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time ,57,positive
12560,Sokka,  i know ,57,positive
12561,Aang,  at least the sokka actor kind of looks like you    that woman playing the avatar doesnt resemble me at all ,57,positive
12562,Toph,i dont know  you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys ,57,positive
12563,Aang,  argh ,57,positive
12564,Katara,relax  aang  theyre not accurate portrayals  its not like im a preachy crybaby who cant resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time    what ,57,positive
12565,Aang,  yeah  thats not you at all ,57,positive
12566,Toph,listen friends  its obvious that the playwright did his research  i know it must hurt  but what youre seeing up there on that stage is the truth ,57,positive
12570,Toph,this is it  this must be where i come in ,57,positive
12573,Toph,  here it comes    ,57,positive
12578,Toph,wait a minute      i sound like a guy  a really buff guy ,57,positive
12579,Katara,well toph  what you hear up there is the truth  it hurts  doesnt it ,57,positive
12580,Toph,are you kidding me  i wouldnt have cast it any other way    at least its not a flying bald lady   ,57,positive
12599,Zuko,did jet just     die ,57,positive
12600,Sokka,you know  it was really unclear ,57,positive
12607,Sokka,  oh  youre getting up    can you get me some fire flakes    ooh  and fire gummies   ,57,positive
12615,Katara,  you didnt really say that  did you ,57,positive
12616,Zuko,i might as well have ,57,positive
12625,Sokka,youre one to talk  suki  didnt azula take you captive  thats right  she did ,57,positive
12627,Sokka,im just saying    ,57,positive
12628,Katara,does anyone know where aang is ,57,positive
12629,Sokka,he left to get me fire gummies  like  ten minutes ago  and im still waiting ,57,positive
12630,Katara,im gonna check outside ,57,positive
12632,Katara,are you all right ,57,positive
12633,Aang,  no  im not  i hate this play   ,57,positive
12634,Katara,i know its upsetting  but it sounds like youre overreacting ,57,positive
12635,Aang,overreacting  if i hadnt blocked my chakra  id probably be in the avatar state right now ,57,positive
12637,Sokka,suki  what are the chances you can get me backstage  i got some jokes i want to give to the actor me ,57,positive
12639,Toph,  geez  everyones getting so upset about their characters  even you seem more down than usual  and thats saying something ,57,positive
12640,Zuko,you dont get it  its different for you  you get a muscly version of yourself  taking down ten bad guys at once  and making sassy remarks ,57,positive
12641,Toph,yeah  thats pretty great ,57,positive
12642,Zuko,but for me  it takes all the mistakes ive made in my life  and shoves them back in my face  my uncle  hes always been on my side  even when things were bad  he was there for me  he taught me so much  and how do i repay him  with a knife in his back  its my greatest regret  and i may never get to redeem myself ,57,positive
12643,Toph,  you have redeemed yourself to your uncle  you dont realize it  but you already have ,57,positive
12644,Zuko,how do you know ,57,positive
12645,Toph,because i once had a long conversation with the guy  and all he would talk about was you ,57,positive
12646,Zuko,really ,57,positive
12647,Toph,yeah  and it was kind of annoying ,57,positive
12648,Zuko,oh  sorry ,57,positive
12649,Toph,but it was also very sweet  all your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path  and see the light  now youre here with us  hed be proud   ,57,positive
12650,Zuko,ow  what was that for ,57,positive
12651,Toph,thats how i show affection ,57,positive
12654,Zuko,the scars not on the wrong side   ,57,positive
12659,Sokka,actually  i think i can help you  im a big sokka fan  but i dont think youre representing him quite as well as you could be ,57,positive
12661,Sokka,  just hear me out    heres something i think the real sokka would say    what does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages  a cabbage patch ,57,positive
12664,Sokka,  also  dont be afraid to make up some phrases  especially before an attack  something like      flying kick a pow     ,57,positive
12666,Sokka,im just a guy who likes comedy ,57,positive
12668,Aang,katara  did you really mean what you said in there ,57,positive
12669,Katara,in where  what are you talking about ,57,positive
12670,Aang,on stage  when you said i was just like a     brother to you  and you didnt have feelings for me ,57,positive
12671,Katara,i didnt say that  an actor said that ,57,positive
12672,Aang,but its true  isnt it  we kissed at the invasion  and i thought we were gonna be together  but were not ,57,positive
12673,Katara,aang  i dont know ,57,positive
12674,Aang,why dont you know ,57,positive
12675,Katara,because  were in the middle of a war  and  we have other things to worry about  this isnt the right time ,57,positive
12676,Aang,well  when is the right time ,57,positive
12677,Katara,aang  im sorry  but right now im just a little confused ,57,positive
12679,Katara,i just said i was confused  im going inside   ,57,positive
12680,Aang,ugh  im such an idiot   ,57,positive
12682,Sokka,heres what you missed     we went to the fire nation  and you got better  and katara was the painted lady  and i got a sword  and i think combustion man died  oh  look  the invasions about to start  shhh ,57,positive
12688,Sokka,  i told him to say that ,57,positive
12695,Sokka,  i guess thats it  the plays caught up to the present now ,57,positive
12697,Sokka,  but it is over  unless       this is the future ,57,positive
12720,Zuko,that     wasnt a good play ,57,positive
12721,Aang,ill say ,57,positive
12722,Katara,no kidding ,57,positive
12724,Toph,you said it ,57,positive
12725,Sokka,  but the effects were decent ,57,positive
12728,Zuko,more ferocious  imagine striking through your opponents heart ,58,positive
12729,Aang,  im trying ,58,positive
12730,Zuko,now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo    that sounded pathetic  i said roar ,58,positive
12732,Katara,  who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice ,58,positive
12733,Aang,  ooh  ooh  me  me  me   ,58,positive
12734,Zuko,  hey    your lessons not over yet  get back here   ,58,positive
12736,Zuko,  fine    if you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day  then go ahead   ,58,positive
12737,Sokka,maybe zukos right  sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy  but i know   just the thing to change all that    beach party ,58,positive
12739,Aang,check out my appa sand sculpture   ,58,positive
12740,Toph,not bad  baldy    but ive been working on my sandbending    youre gonna love this ,58,positive
12742,Aang,  whoa  wow  youve even made a little earth king and bosco ,58,positive
12744,Toph,try and top that  sokka ,58,positive
12745,Sokka,  ta da ,58,positive
12746,Aang,is that a blubbering blob monster ,58,positive
12747,Sokka,  no  its suki ,58,positive
12749,Toph,suki  well all understand if you break up with him over this ,58,positive
12752,Aang,but it doesnt even look like  aah ,58,positive
12754,Aang,  what are you doing ,58,positive
12755,Zuko,teaching you a lesson ,58,positive
12757,Katara,what happened ,58,positive
12758,Sokka,  zukos gone crazy  i made a sand sculpture of suki and he destroyed it    oh  and hes attacking aang ,58,positive
12760,Aang,get a grip before i blast you off this roof ,58,positive
12761,Zuko,go ahead and do it ,58,positive
12763,Aang,enough ,58,positive
12765,Katara,  whats wrong with you  you could have hurt aang ,58,positive
12766,Zuko,whats wrong with me  whats wrong with all of you  how can you sit around having beach parties when sozins comet is only three days away    why are you all looking at me like im crazy ,58,positive
12767,Aang,about sozins comet     i was actually gonna wait to fight the fire lord until after it came ,58,positive
12768,Zuko,  after ,58,positive
12769,Aang,im not ready  i need more time to master firebending ,58,positive
12770,Toph,and frankly  your earthbending could still use some work too   ,58,positive
12771,Zuko,so  you all knew aang was going to wait ,58,positive
12772,Sokka,honestly  if aang tries to fight the fire lord now  hes going to lose    no offense ,58,positive
12773,Katara,the whole point of fighting the fire lord before the comet was to stop the fire nation from winning the war  but they pretty much won the war when they took ba sing se  things cant get any worse ,58,positive
12774,Zuko,youre wrong    its about to get worse than you can even imagine    the day before the eclipse  my father asked me to attend an important war meeting  it was what i dreamed about for so many years  my father had finally accepted me back ,58,positive
12780,Zuko,the people of the earth kingdom are proud and strong  they can endure anything  as long as they have hope ,58,positive
12782,Zuko,well  thats not exactly what i ,58,positive
12783,Azula,i think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground ,58,positive
12787,Zuko,  i wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan  but im ashamed to say i didnt    my whole life  i struggled to gain my fathers love and acceptance  but once i had it  i realized id lost myself getting there  id forgotten who i was ,58,positive
12788,Katara,  i cant believe this ,58,positive
12789,Sokka,i always knew the fire lord was a bad guy  but his plan is just pure evil ,58,positive
12790,Aang,what am i gonna do ,58,positive
12791,Zuko,  i know youre scared  and i know youre not ready to save the world  but if you dont defeat the fire lord before the comet comes  there wont be a world to save anymore ,58,positive
12792,Aang,why didnt you tell me about your dads crazy plan sooner   ,58,positive
12793,Zuko,i didnt think i had to  i assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet  no one told me you decided to wait ,58,positive
12794,Aang,  this is bad    this is really  really bad ,58,positive
12795,Katara,aang  you dont have to do this alone ,58,positive
12797,Toph,yeah  if we all fight the fire lord together  we got a shot at taking him down ,58,positive
12798,Sokka,all right  team avatar is back  air    water    earth    fire    fan and sword   ,58,positive
12799,Aang,fighting the fire lord is going to be the hardest thing weve ever done together  but i wouldnt want to do it any other way ,58,positive
12801,Toph,yeah ,58,positive
12802,Sokka,all right ,58,positive
12803,Katara,get over here  zuko  being part of the group also means being part of group hugs ,58,positive
12805,Zuko,theres one technique you need to know before facing my father   how to redirect lightning    if you let the energy in your own body flow  the lightning will follow it    you turn your opponents energy against them ,58,positive
12806,Aang,thats like waterbending   ,58,positive
12807,Zuko,exactly  my uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders ,58,positive
12808,Aang,so  have you ever redirected lightning before ,58,positive
12809,Zuko,once  against my father ,58,positive
12810,Aang,what did it feel like ,58,positive
12811,Zuko,  exhilarating       but terrifying  you feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body  but you know if you make the wrong move  its over ,58,positive

12847,Zuko,well  that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster  and the worst father in the history of fathers ,58,positive
12848,Aang,  but hes still a human being ,58,positive
12849,Zuko,youre going to defend him ,58,positive
12850,Aang,no  i agree with you    fire lord ozai is a horrible person  and the world would probably be better off without him  but theres got to be another way ,58,positive
12851,Zuko,like what ,58,positive
12852,Aang,i dont know    maybe we can make some big pots of glue  and then i can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he cant bend anymore ,58,positive
12853,Zuko,  yeah  then you can show him his baby pictures  and all those happy memories will make him good again   ,58,positive
12854,Aang,  do you really think that would work ,58,positive
12855,Zuko,  no ,58,positive
12856,Aang,  this goes against everything i learned from the monks  i cant just go around wiping out people i dont like ,58,positive
12857,Sokka,sure you can  youre the avatar  if its in the name of keeping balance  im pretty sure the universe will forgive you ,58,positive
12858,Aang,  this isnt a joke  sokka  none of you understand the position im in ,58,positive
12859,Katara,aang  we do understand  its just    ,58,positive
12860,Aang,just what  katara  what ,58,positive
12861,Katara,were trying to help ,58,positive

12863,Katara,aang  dont walk away from this   ,58,positive
12864,Zuko,  let him go  he needs time to sort it out by himself ,58,positive
12866,Aang,  hey  momo  i dont suppose you know what i should do    i didnt think so ,58,positive

12877,Sokka,look  theres his footprints    the trail ends here ,58,positive
12879,Katara,maybe he was captured ,58,positive
12880,Sokka,i dont think so    theres no sign of a struggle ,58,positive
12881,Toph,i bet he ran away again ,58,positive
12882,Sokka,uh uh  he left behind his glider and appa ,58,positive
12883,Toph,then what do you think happened to him  oh sleuthy one ,58,positive
12884,Sokka,its pretty obvious  aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle  hes definitely on a spirit world journey ,58,positive
12885,Zuko,but if he was  wouldnt his body still be here ,58,positive
12886,Sokka,  oh  yeah  forgot about that ,58,positive

12897,Zuko,  look  i know you had a really rough childhood  but we should really focus on finding aang   ,58,positive
12898,Toph,this is the worst field trip ever   ,58,positive
12900,Sokka,judging by the looks on your faces  im guessing you guys didnt find aang  either   ,58,positive
12901,Zuko,no  its like he just     disappeared ,58,positive
12902,Toph,hey  wait a minute  has anyone noticed that momo is missing  too ,58,positive
12903,Sokka,  oh no  i knew it was only a matter of time    appa ate momo    momo  im coming for you  buddy ,58,positive
12904,Katara,sokka  appa didnt eat momo  hes probably with aang ,58,positive
12905,Sokka,thats just what appa wants you to think   ,58,positive
12906,Zuko,get out of the bisons mouth  sokka  we have a real problem here  aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away ,58,positive
12907,Katara,what should we do zuko ,58,positive

13026,Aang,avatar kyoshi  i need your wisdom ,59,positive
13029,Aang,  you didnt really kill chin    technically  he fell to his own doom because he was too stubborn to get out of the way ,59,positive
13031,Aang,  i knew i shouldnt have asked kyoshi ,59,positive
13033,Sokka,so  bumi       how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in omashu ,59,positive

13055,Zuko,  no  im not okay  my uncle hates me  i know it    he loved and supported me in every way he could  and i still turned against him  how can i even face him ,59,positive
13056,Katara,  zuko  youre sorry for what you did  right ,59,positive
13057,Zuko,more sorry than ive been about anything in my entire life ,59,positive
13058,Katara,then hell forgive you  he will ,59,positive
13060,Zuko,uncle ,59,positive
13062,Aang,  all these past avatars    they keep telling me im gonna have to do it  they dont get it    youre right  maybe an air nomad avatar will understand where im coming from    i know you cant really talk  pretending you can just helps me think    im going to pretend i didnt pretend to hear that ,59,positive
13065,Aang,avatar yangchen    the monks always taught me that all life is sacred  even the life of the tiniest spider fly caught in its own web ,59,positive
13067,Aang,  i know  im even a vegetarian  ive always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever  and ive only had to use violence for necessary defense  and ive certainly never used it to take a life ,59,positive
13069,Aang,but the monks taught me that i had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free ,59,positive
13071,Aang,  i guess i dont have a choice  momo    i have to kill the fire lord ,59,positive
13073,Zuko,  uncle    i know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me    but i want you to know    i am so  so  sorry  uncle  i am so sorry and ashamed of what i did  i dont know how i can ever make it up to you  but ill    how can you forgive me so easily  i thought you would be furious with me ,59,positive
13074,Iroh,  i was never angry with you  i was sad because i was afraid you lost your way ,59,positive
13075,Zuko,  i did lose my way ,59,positive
13076,Iroh,  but you found it again    and you did it by yourself    and i am so happy you found your way here   ,59,positive
13077,Zuko,it wasnt that hard  uncle  you have a pretty strong scent ,59,positive
13079,Aang,wait    is it just me  or are those mountains getting bigger ,59,positive
13081,Aang,theyre not getting larger    theyre getting closer    the whole island is moving ,59,positive
13083,Aang,its amazing momo  the biggest animal in the world  ive gotta to swim around and find its face   ,59,positive
13085,Zuko,  uncle  youre the only person other than the avatar who can   possibly defeat the father lord ,59,positive
13086,Toph,you mean the fire lord ,59,positive
13087,Zuko,  thats what i just said ,59,positive
13088,Iroh,hmmm    ,59,positive
13089,Zuko,we need you to come with us ,59,positive
13090,Iroh,  no  zuko  it wont turn out well ,59,positive
13091,Zuko,  you can beat him    and well be there to help ,59,positive
13092,Iroh,even if i did defeat ozai    and i dont know that i could  it would be the wrong way to end the war    history would see it as just more senseless violence  a brother killing a brother to grab power  the only way for this war to end peacefully is for the avatar to defeat the fire lord ,59,positive
13093,Zuko,  and then     then you would come and take your rightful place on the throne ,59,positive
13094,Iroh,  no  someone new must take the throne  an idealist with a pure heart   and unquestionable honor  it has to be you  prince zuko ,59,positive
13095,Zuko,  unquestionable honor  but ive made so many mistakes ,59,positive
13096,Iroh,yes  you have    youve struggled  youve suffered  but you have always followed your own path    you restored your own honor  and only you can restore the honor of the fire nation ,59,positive
13097,Zuko,  ill try  uncle ,59,positive
13098,Toph,  well  what if aang doesnt come back ,59,positive
13099,Iroh,  sozins comet is arriving  and our destinies are upon us  aang will face the fire lord    when i was a boy  i had a vision that i would one day take ba sing se    only now do i see that my destiny is to take it back from the fire nation    so the earth kingdom can be free again ,59,positive
13101,Iroh,yes    zuko  you must return to the fire nation  so that when the fire lord falls  you can assume the throne and restore peace and order    but azula will be there  waiting for you ,59,positive
13102,Zuko,i can handle azula ,59,positive
13103,Iroh,not alone    youll need help ,59,positive
13104,Zuko,  youre right  katara    how would you like to help me put azula in her place ,59,positive
13105,Katara,it would be my pleasure ,59,positive
13106,Sokka,what about us    whats our destiny today ,59,positive
13107,Iroh,  what do you think it is ,59,positive
13108,Sokka,  i think that  even though we dont know where aang is  we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet ,59,positive
13109,Toph,  and that means when aang does face the fire lord  well be right there if he needs us   ,59,positive
13112,Sokka,  thank you  master ,59,positive
13114,Zuko,  so if im going to be fire lord after the war is over    what are you going to do ,59,positive

13120,Aang,  a lion turtle    maybe you can help me  everyone  even my own past lives  are expecting me to end someones life    but i dont know if i can do it ,59,positive
13128,Katara,zuko  dont worry  we can take azula ,60,positive
13129,Zuko,its not her im worried about  im worried about aang  what if he doesnt have the guts to take out my father  what if he loses ,60,positive
13130,Katara,  aang wont lose  hes gonna come back    he has to   ,60,positive
13132,Azula,  what am i holding ,60,positive
13134,Azula,correct  and what day is this ,60,positive

13154,Azula,actually  everythings not all right  do you know how long it took you to get here ,60,positive
13156,Azula,five  to be precise  in which time an assassin couldve snuck in  done away with me and been on his merry way ,60,positive
13158,Azula,is this how you plan to treat your new fire lord  with tardiness and disloyalty ,60,positive
13160,Azula,and im sure thats just what you told long feng before you turned against him and joined me    youre all banished ,60,positive
13162,Azula,goodbye ,60,positive

13192,Azula,  my father asked you to come here and talk to me  didnt he   he thinks i cant handle the responsibility of being fire lord  but i will be the greatest leader in fire nation history ,60,positive
