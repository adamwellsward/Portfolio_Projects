**Welcome!**

This repository holds my personal coding endeavors, coding competition files, and other related projects. 
Each folder contains one of my most recent projects, detailed below:

**AVATAR:**

  An NLP approach to analyzing my favorite TV series of all time, Avatar: The Last Airbender. Sentiment analysis was performed using the Hugging Face 'transformers' 
package to discover insights into different characters' dialogue patterns.

**CAR ACCIDENT SEVERITY:**

  Used ML techniques to predict car accident severity in the state of Utah using a national data set with 7.7 million data points. Includes a 5-page technical paper documenting techniques and results.

**MODELING RELATIONSHIP HAPPINESS:**

  Implementation of numerical methods to plot Ordinary Differential Equations modeling individual happiness in relationships. Includes a 10-page paper documenting techniques and results.
  
**PROJECT EULER:**

  Includes over 20 solutions (and counting!) to basic Project Euler coding problems. My side gig.
